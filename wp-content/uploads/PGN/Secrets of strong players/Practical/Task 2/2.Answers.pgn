Nfd7 (26... exf4 27. Qxf4 {White has a very good central control and active
pieces. The position is almost equal, but it looks scary to play e5 and pin
the g6-pawn. Thus, White has some attacking posibilities thanks to the weakned
black kingside.}) 27. Qxe7 Rxe7 28. fxe5 {White grabs the opportunity to
double his pawns. White didn't manage to perform a kingside attack, and this
is not always possible. In any case, he has very active pieces and space
advantage.} dxe5 29. Rd1 $1 {To take is a mistake, as you already know and,
for that reason, Carlsen doesn't capture the pawn on e5, but he keeps pressing
the center. Please remember that you're placing the rooks behind the pawns in
order to push them. And this is what he is trying to do here, to push d5 in
the apropriate moment or to capture on e5 and have an active rook on the
d-line.} Re8 30. dxe5 {In chess, we're following the rules. Usually, the rules
are good 8 times out of 10. However, sometimes it's OK, or even necessary, to
break the rules in order to find the best moves. Carlsen breaks the rule "to
take is a mistake" thanks to very concrete reasons: he would like to increase
his central superiority, and he immediately pushes the f-pawn to f4.} Nxe5 31.
f4 Ng4 32. Rd6 $14 {I guess that you can see clearly now how active and good
coordinated White's pieces are. The rook is extremely active on d6; pressing
the c6- and g6-pawns. White has a fantastic control over the center, and he
can push these pawns at any time he wants. After the e5 advancment, the
c2-bishop will be activated by pinning the g6-pawn; thus, Nxh5 will be a
threat. As you can understand, all of White's pieces are coordinating very
well. On the other hand, we cannot say the same for Black's pieces: how are
Nb6 and Ng4 connected? How are they working for the same purpose? Similalry,
the e8-rook cannot really stop or blockade White's central pawns. For the
above mentioned reasons, White has a small but stable advantage, and he
manages to win the game afterwards.} Re6 33. Rd8 Kg7 34. Nf1 Rf6 35. h3 Nh6 36.

recapture on c4 with the queen, and then transfer the rooks to the b-line to

pawn, your queen will be outside for some time, at the edge of the board.
Black captured this pawn because he will attack the b2; so, he can exchange
queens. White needs a lot of tempi in order to create a real threat. For
example, he needs to play f5, capture on g6; then he should recapture on fxg6,
then to capture on b6 and then to give a double attack on c4 with the bishop.
Definitely, White has compensation for the pawn, but the pawn is a pawn. Black
