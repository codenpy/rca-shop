$1 {White started immediately a center assault in order to kick Black's pieces
from good positions. It looks strange to attack the center so early and move
the pawns in the opening, but you should start the attack after your
opponent's mistake. It was a mistake from Black's point of view to play d6 and
e6.} (7. g4 $5) (7. Be2 $5) 7... exd5 8. exd5 Bxf3 9. Qxf3 Ne5 10. Qf4 {
White is playing in the center and keeps an eye on the a4. From f4, the queen
can go fast to the king or queenside.} (10. Qg3 $5 {This was another very
interesting move. If you can prevent or harm your opponent's development, then
you may do it. After this move, it's difficult for Black to develop the
f8-bishop.}) 10... Be7 11. O-O-O {White has a fantastic development, good
control over the center, space advantage and the bishop pair.Later on, he can
attack on the kingside by starting pushing the pawns there. He has a good

{White is playing for the control of the center. If Black doesn't know what to
do here, he will face huge problems because White has a dominant position.
Black's problem is that the c8- and f8-bishops are very passive. Similalry,
it's difficult for Black to perform the e5 move.} Bd7 (7... Be7) (7... Ne4 {
Black should try to do something dynamic, as Ne4 or Be7, and then, Ne4 because
he has activity problems and his pieces are extremely passive.}) 8. Rb1 (8. a3
$5 {This is a very strong idea in order to play b4. By that White will win
space on the queenside, a potential breakthrough with b5 and c6, in the
appropriate moment. As we mentioned earlier, the e5 move is difficult to
perform because Black has no active pieces and counterplay.} b6 9. b4) 8... b6

over the center is impressive, isn't it? He played b4 in order to stop, or
make harder the liberating advancement to c5. If Black stays with the c7 pawn,
then it is weak and White can start attacking it hardly. Similalry, if this
pawn stays there, it will hamper Black's pieces activity. White enjoys the
central control and domination; so, he can easily maneuver or regroup his
pieces behing his strong center.} Ne7 20. Nc3 $1 {When you have more space
it's important to keep the material on the board; this is a fundamental rule
in chess. With more space, you can regroup more easily your pieces and create
better plans. With less space, it's difficult to play and find accurate moves.}
Ng6 21. Nd5 (21. a4 $5 {This was a very intresting move to open lines on the
queenside and take use of Black's cramped pieces. Please note that the
a7-bishop is unprotected; so, it could be a potential tactical problem for the
future.}) 21... Nf6 (21... Bxd5 $5 22. exd5 {Yes, Black can harm White's
central domination, but the c7-pawn will be weak forever. Similarly, the
a7-bishop is stil out of play. Even if it was a good decision to capture on d5
with the bishop, Black is afraid of the c7-weakness and the a7-bishop
passivity; so, he doesn't play that move.}) 22. Nxf6+ Qxf6 23. Qd2 $14 {
Black manages to exchange one pair of knighs, and this is very good for him.
However, still White has central domination and active pieces; so, he has the
advantage. After a long fight, White's player manages to win the game.} Nh4 24.
