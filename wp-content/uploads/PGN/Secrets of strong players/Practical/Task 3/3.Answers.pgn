, White keeps the queens on the board following the rule "to take is a
mistake". Similarly, when the opponent's king is not secure, you should keep
the queens on the board in order to create attacking chances; and this is what
Magnus is doing here.} (25. Qxc3 Rxc3 $132 {Black will not face problems here.}

strategic rules, when your opponent's king is in the center of the board, then

secure. Now you can see the consequences of not trading the queens; Black's
king is in a very dangerous position. White needs to activate his queen and
rook.} Bxh1 29. Rh2 Rxe5 30. Rh8+ Ke7 31. Qa7+ {
This check is deadly, and Black cannot protect his king; so, he resigns.} (31.

mistake". You may see that even the computer suggests to capture on d1, but
this wasn't necessary. It was more important to activate the h6-rook first;
something you're going to do in any case. Thinking in this way, chess is
easier, isn't it? Similalry, we can say that even the 13.Bxh6 move wasn't the
best.} (17... Bxf3) (17... Rxd1 18. Rxd1 Bxf3 (18... Be3 19. Neg5 Bxf4 20. Nxf7

15. Nxb6 axb6 16. Qb3 Ra6 17. Rfc1 Bh3 {Diagram #} 18. Bf3 {To take is a
mistake. There is no need to capture the bishop on h3 because Black's queen
will land on h3 and the pressure against the d5-pawn will disappear.} Bg4 19.
Bg2 Bh3 20. Bf3 {The Russian rule says: if you can repeat the position once,
then you may do it. In general, its OK to repeat the position once, and gain
some time on the clock or be closer to the 40 moves.} Bg4 21. Bh1 {Finally, White
is keeping the light-squared bishop, and Black cannot challenge it anymore.
The h1-bishop is more active because it attacks the d5-pawn and it is
coordinating with the queen. Similalry, keeping it, White's king will feel
safer.} h5 22. h4 {It is a very big question on how to stop the enemy pawn
advancement on h5. Sometimes, you can play h3 or h4 and, other times, you can
leave it perform its idea, and you will not stop h4 at all. You should think
about it in connection with other pieces. Can Black bring more pieces into the
attack? In any case, White decides to stop it once and forever.} Be2 23. Kh2 {
White is dominating his own light squares around his king, g2 and h3. The king
is safe here and, similarly, he stops the queen's penetration to h3.} Qf5 24.
Bg2 Na5 25. Qc3 Nc6 26. b3 {White is giving a great fight on the light squares.
It's difficult for Black's pieces to find some active squares. Please also
notice that the e2-bishop is not very well coordinated with the other black
pieces, and it is on White's territory. This is a dangerous strategy because
this bishop may be trapped.} b5 27. Qd2 Bf3 {Diagram #} 28. Bf1 $1 {This is a
beautiful and very powerful move which follow the rule "to take is a mistake"!
White refuses to exchange the bishops because he has a more ambitious plan in
mind, to trap the f3-bishop.} Rb6 29. Bf4 $1 {
There is nothing that Black can do against the threat of c3 and f3.} Rc8 30.
Rc3 Bg4 31. f3 $18 {White is winning the bishop and the game after some moves.}
