14. Ne5 {White has a clear strategical plan, to attack the isolated c5-pawn.
In such cases, you need to exchange some of the light pieces in order to
reduce the opponent's counterplay. Then, you need to attack this pawn with
your heavy pieces. Hence, White tries to exchange the knights, and then, to
increase the pressure against the c5-pawn.} (14. Bg5 $5) (14. Rfd1 $5) 14...
Qb6 15. Nxc6 Rxc6 16. b3 {Another very good and didactic move. White has other
ways to protect the b2-pawn; for example, to play Rc2. However, he uses the
economical defense (if you don't know what it is, you are welcome to study the
RCA course "Defending Champion") and, similarly, he is blocking the c4-square.
Moreover, he creates a solid outpost on a4 for the knight. From there, the
knight can free the c-line and increase the pressure against the c5-square.} h6
17. Rfd1 Qb7 (17... Qa6 $5 {It's not recommended to transpose the game into

active counterplay with his pieces.} 18. Qxa6 Rxa6 19. Na4 Nd5 $132) 18. h3
Rfc8 19. Na4 $14 {You can see clearly White's strategy in action. He blocked
the c-pawn, his pieces are active and Black has the luck to counterplay. In
order to have a successful strategy against the isolated pawn, you need to
block or control the square, and then, to attack it with your pieces. Then you
have two strategies: Firstly, you can regroup your pieces in order to continue
pressing this pawn, by doubling the rooks on the c-line, and put the queen on
c1 behind the rooks. This is the Alekhine gun. Secondly, you need to find a
second weakness. You can continue activating your pieces; for example,
doubling the rooks on the d-line, and then, creating a kingside superiority,
by bringing there more pieces. In any case, Carlsen has a small but stable
advantage here, and he manages to win the game afterwards.} Nd7 20. Rd2 Nb6 21.

$1 {Black has a very active knight on f5 and he hasn't castle yet; thus, you
may think that it's possible to start a kingside attack. However, Black's
intention is to control the center, secure the knight outpost with h5 and play
a position with a good knight against a bad bishop. Black plays the best move
in the position, a5! He limits the mobility of the bishop, stops it from
landing on b6 and secures his dominance on the c-line. Black's main goal is to
fight for the initiative and activity of his pieces.} (20... h4 $5) (20... Qc6
$5) (20... Qe7 $2 21. Bc5 $5 (21. Rc2 $5)) (20... Qd7 $6 21. Bc5) 21. Ra1 Qd7 {
He is dominating on the light squares, overprotecting the important d4-pawn
and preparing to 0-0 and double the rooks on the c-line.} 22. Qf3 Qd5 {
It is totally ok for Black to exchange queens even if he doubles the central
pawns. White cannot attack them because it cannot enter the files. After the
queen's exchange, Black's king will be safe on d7, and Black's plan is to
double on the c-line. The rooks belong to the open lines. Please also notice
that the doubled pawns will help Black find a good outpost on the c-line in
order to use it and double the rooks there.} 23. Qxd5 exd5 24. Rfc1 Kd7 25. Be1
{This is another very cool move! White successfully cover the entry points on
the c-file, and Black cannot make any progress there easily. For that reason,
Black is trying to open more lines for the rooks. He is trying to open the g-
and e-lines. Probably, he will not be able to attack the king by doubling the
rooks on the g-line, but the e-file will be important. It will be difficult
for White to protect all of the entry squares.} f6 26. exf6 gxf6 27. Kf2 Ne3
28. Kf3 {Grandmasters and strong players can exchange one advantage with
another. Black gives up his best piece, the knight, in order to eliminate the
defender of the c3- and e3-squares. After that, he manages do dominate in the
c-line and to win the game.} Nc2 29. Ra2 Nxe1+ 30. Rxe1 Rc3 31. Rae2 Rxd3+ 32.

Ne7 9. b4 Ne8 {Diagram #} 10. c5 $5 {The King's Indian Defense (KID) is a
characteristic opening in which White makes a queenside attack and Black tries
to checkmate White's monarch. If Black's attack fails or delays, then he's
dead lost from the other side of the board. This is a critical moment for
White because he has plenty of moves available. White's main strategical idea
is to break through with the c5 move, which Ernst played immediately.} (10. a3

makes more solid the bone structure, and transfers the knight to the new free
c4-square.} Nf6 12. a4 f4 13. Nc4 {We can see clearly now how White is
improving his queenside attack by pressing the d6-pawn hardly. The computer
gives clearly the advantage to White and, indeed, he has a strategic advantage.
However, the attack against the enemy king is often very dangerous and, for
that, KID is very popular for playing at any level.} g5 14. Nb5 {White continues
pressing the same square, d6. This is a model game on how to attack with
White against the KID.} Ne8 15. Ba3 {Even if this bishop looks closed, it has
an eye on the d6-pawn. If you imagine that the d6-pawn is the opponent king,
then you can develop your attack against that square more naturally, am I
right?} Ng6 16. Bg4 {This is a very important strategic exchange because
Black's light-squared bishop is an important piece on the attack. White has
