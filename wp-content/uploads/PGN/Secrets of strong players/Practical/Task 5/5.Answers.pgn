White has a big advantage thanks to his material superiority.} 19. Be3 Bxe3+

block the f-line with the Bf3 move. Similarly, Black doesn't have direct
threats.} Rxf6 22. Bf3 Qe7 23. Kd2 {White has the advantage because he stopped
Black's attack, and he managed to win the game afterwards.} (23. Kf2 $5) 23...

Black should prepare this move with Nbd7; it's dangerous to do it immediately.}
(6... c6) (6... Nc6) (6... Nbd7) 7. dxc5 Qa5 {Diagram #} 8. cxd6 $1 {Black 
started a very fast attack, and White should be careful because he didn't fully
develop his army yet. In reality, White can stop Black's threats because Black
hasn't developed all of his pieces.} (8. Bxf6 $5 {This move is interesting
because you are eliminating a developed piece and continue capturing material.}
Bxf6 9. cxd6 exd6 10. Nd5 $1 Qxd2+ 11. Rxd2 $16) 8... exd6 9. Bh6 $2 {
In the opening, it's very important to develop all of your pieces and not move
the same piece twice. After the Bc4 move, he will have a fantastic central
control and a good development. Black's attack was premature and White's
player managed to stop it; so, he won the game afterwards.} (9. Bc4 $1 $16)

finalize her development and she started an attack in the kingside. Even if
she manages to open the h-line, a thing that is difficult, she doesn't have
enough pieces to create real threats. On the other hand, White's attack is
more realistic because her pieces are better developed.} (12. Nh4 $1 {
This was a very interesting move in order to stop the premature attack and
activate the g2-bishop.}) (12. Bf4 $5) (12. a4 $5) 12... Bh6 {
Another pointless move which helps only White.} (12... Bg4 $5) 13. c4 {
White continues with the attack. Black's pieces aren't good organized and
White is trying to open lines against the enemy king. The idea is to play c5
in order to fix the enemy pawn structure and, then, to break throught with b5.}
Kb8 14. c5 Nf8 15. b5 $1 {It's very important to open lines by exchanging your
pawns, in order to fully activate your pieces and create threats.} cxb5 16.

Black's premature attack. White has a winning advantage, and she manages to

White is bringing all of the bridges. After this sacrifice, there is no

thanks to his material disadvantage.} (16. Nxc8+ Rxc8 (16... Qxc8 17. Qa5 $36)

the board and he cannot create any real threats against the Kb1. Similarly,
