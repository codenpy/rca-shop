15. h4 Rfc8 16. b3 Rc7 {Diagram #} 17. Nb5 $1 {The battle takes place on the
queenside and, more specifically, both sides would like to double the rooks on
the c-line. White has good control over the center and he would like to expand
his domination to the queenside. Yes, doubled pawns could be a potential
weakness, but White "sacrificed" his healthy pawn structure in order to
activate his rooks.} (17. Na2 $5) (17. Bd2 $5) (17. Kf1 $5) (17. Be3 $5) 17...

White is placing his rook on the strong outpost, helped by a pawn, in order to
dominate over the c-line.} Kf8 21. e4 $5 {This is an extremely interesting
idea in order to fully activate all of his pieces!} (21. Kf1 $5 {
Another idea was to activate the king towards the center.}) 21... a4 {
Black tries to exchange pawns, but another very interesting option was to
capture on e4 and play Rd8 to find counterplay in White's weak pawns.} (21...

is fighting for the win here. If he manages to coordinate his pieces and push
his queenside pawn majority, then Black will face huge troubles.} Be5 28. Be3 {
Of course, White would like to keep his pieces on the board in order to
support his queenside pawns.White's position is very solid; but Black, even if
he has an extra queen, cannot find targets for attack.} fxe6 29. Bxb7 {
Black should play a precise defense in order not to lose the game...} Bd4 $8 (

This is just an ilustrative variation.}) 30. Nc4 $2 {This wasn't the best move

position. We have a strategical endgame, nor a middlegame. The queens are
missing, but still we have plenty of pieces on the board. White understands
that he has space advantage in the kingside and Black has some weaknesses
there. For that reason, he activates his knight and he would like to open
lines; not necessarily to attack the enemy king but weak squares around him.} (
17. Rcc1 $5) (17. Bb5 $5) (17. Be2 $5) (17. Rd1 $5) 17... b6 18. f4 {Now we can

hottest point! We can see here that the center of the board is open and, due
to this fact, both players can use their active pieces in order to create
threats. Black cannot accept the sacrificed piece on g7 because he will face
an extremely strong attack, as you can see in the sub-variations.} (24. Nd5 $5)

It's always useful to capture a pawn. Another interesting idea is to play Bd4.}
(25. Bd4 $18 {
White is threatening to remove the defender, to capture on c5 and then on b3.})
25... Bf6 26. Ne5 {White immediately breaks the pin and, at the same time, he
is attacking the g4-rook. Black's problem is that his pieces are not
coordinated.} Bxe5 27. Rxe5 {White isn't threatening to capture on c5 and then
on b3, but he wants to increase the pressure with Ne4.} Qb6 (27... -- 28. Ne4 {
Increasing the pressure with the pin on c5.}) 28. Qd2 {White protects the Bh6,
a piece that was under attack by the queen, and leaves the dangerous b-file in
order to avoid any threats like Bc4, attacking the b2-queen and f1-rook.} Rg6
29. Be3 {Again, Carlsen creates a pin in order to immobilize the enemy pieces.
A pin is a stronger than a sword!} Qc6 30. Nd5 $1 {The g3 move was another
interesting option in order to protect himself against the checkmate on g2.
However, Magnus preferred not to create weaknesses on the light quares and,
similarly, he creates the Ne7 threat. White has a clear advantage, and he
manages to win the game afterwards.} (30. g3 $5) 30... Bxd5 31. Qxd5 b6 32. g3

$5) 19... Rxf7 $1 {It was better for White to keep the bishop on c2. He will
take back the pieces, but he gave up the bishop pair and decreased some
potentials from his pawn structure.} (19... Kxf7 $5 {
This is also an interesting choice, but there is no need to expose your king.})
20. b4 Bxb4 21. cxb4 Nc6 {Black brings his knight into the game, attacking the
b4-pawn. After the changes, you should evaluate what pieces stay in the board;
and the c1-bishop isn't a great piece.} 22. Nc2 Qc8 {Strong players always do
such moves. He is provoking the g4 move and, after that, the Nf6 found a
target on the g4-pawn. Similarly, it tights down the d1-queen in defense.} 23.
g4 Qa8 {Heavy pieces belong to the open lines. The a-line is a good
opportunity for Black's queen in order to penetrate into White's camp.} 24. f3
Qa2 {Black's pieces are already extremely active and, if White doesn't do
anything, then he will prepare d5 and e4.} 25. d4 Re7 26. dxe5 dxe5 27. Qd3 e4

bishop is closed; so, Black has a clear advantage here, and he manages to win

{As I mentioned in a previous task, Black has 3 options on how to stop the
h4-h5 advancement. Black is dominating on f4 and d4, two dark squares, and he
would like to place his knights there.} 8. Nh2 Bg7 9. Ng4 Nge7 {Black is kipping
the knights on the board because the position is closed and he has good
prospects, good squares on d4 and f4 for them. Of course, White also has good
squares for his own knights, on d5 and f5. In general, the knights are the
salt and pepper of the game... :-)} 10. Ne3 O-O 11. Bd2 Kh8 12. g4 Rb8 $1 {
The position is totally blocked, and White has more space thanks to his
h5-pawn. Black played a very good move, Rb8, with the idea of playing b4, the
breakthrough. Black cannot attack in the center nor on the kingside, it's
White who theoreticaly attacks; so, Black should attack on the queenside.} 13.
a4 Nd4 14. Ncd5 Nxd5 15. Nxd5 Ne6 {The computer assesses the position as a
little better for White thanks to his space advantage mainly, but White has no
good breakthrough. Right now, White manages to prevent the b5 advancement, but
Black can prepare it in the future with the a6 and b5 moves. For the above
mentioned reason, Black has better prospects in the future.} 16. f3 Nf4 {
In reality, White cannot capture this knight because, after exf4, the g7-bishop 
will come into life!} 17. Qb1 Be6 18. Qa2 Qd7 {Black finalized his development
and, by his last move, he might like to sacrifice a light piece on g4. This
could be a very unpleasant situation for White. Black will not win by force
after this sacrifice, but he can get two pawns in return and a lot of
attacking possibilities. Please notice that almost all of White's pieces are
placed on the queenside. This is the reason why White played Rg1 in the next
move; to preven this sacrificial idea.} 19. Rg1 b6 {This is a very important
preperational move. If Black plays immediately a6 in order to play b5 in the
next move, White can stop this idea by playing a5 himself!} (19... a6 20. a5 $1
) 20. Bc3 Bxd5 {Black used this tactical idea, to exchange the powerful
d5-knight for the bishop in order to promote his main idea, b5. After Bxd5 and
Bxd5, White no longer controls a6; so, Black has time to play a6 and b5.} 21.
Bxd5 a6 22. Bd2 Qe7 {Sooner or later, White has to capture the knight on f4
and, for that reason, Magnus is preparing to activate his queen via the dark
squares.} 23. Rf1 b5 {Finally, Black manages to perform his breakthrough.} 24.
axb5 axb5 25. Kf2 c4 {Black has activated his pieces, and now he starts
pressing White's position with his powerful knight on f4. So, White should
exchange it.} 26. Bxf4 exf4 27. Rad1 f5 $1 {When all of your pieces are active,
then you should look for tactics and breakthroughs. White's king isn't safe
and, for that reason, Black is trying to open the lines there and attack him.
Black uses his active pieces, and he manages to win the game atferwards.} 28.
