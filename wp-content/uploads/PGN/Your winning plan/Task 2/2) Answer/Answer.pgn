(Of course it is good to know an opening theory. However, even if you don't
know it - all the previous moves should be done quite quickly. The position is
not stable and it makes no sense to compose a plan here.)} e5
{(here white should compose a plan: 1) It is the end of an opening stage; 2) Black made a pawn move.)}
12.d5 Nb8 13.Rfe1 {(As usual first of all we should play in a center. That's why white is trying to prepare the move e4.)}
Re8 ( 13...Nd7 {?} 14.Nxe5 Bxg2 15.Nxd7 $18 ) 14.Rac1 {?! (a deflection from the white's plan)}
Nd7 15.Bf1 {(white is preparing Ng5 and e4)} Bxf3 16.exf3 {(Now white should think about a plan again: 1) an exchanges happened 2) a pawn move was made.)}
f5 17.b4 b6 {
(black made a pawn move and white should make corrections in his plan. Black
has created weaknesses on the queen-side. White can use it by transferring the bishop Be2-d1-a4-c6.)}
18.Bd3 Re7 19.Re2 Qf8 20.Rce1 h5 {
(This is a pawn move, but it doesn't change something for white. Black is
stronger on the king-side and he is realizing his attacking plan there. White
should continue playing in the center and on the queen-side. That's why the
last black's move doesn't make any changes for white. You see that not ALL the
pawn moves are a signal for making adjustments in your plan.)}
21.Kh1 Kh7 22.Bc2 Rd8 23.Ba4 Rf7 24.Qc2 f4 {
? (this is a pawn move, which weakens the black's central and king-side
position. White may try to use it. We should not think about a planning too
much here, because it is a tactical position and we should rather calculate the concrete variations.)}

(The tactical complications have finished, the position became stable - so
white should compose the new plan. Of course first of all white should occupy the center.)}

 (White has a domination in the center, but there is no way to continue the
attack here. That's why white should transfer the attack on a side.)}

white can now use his passed pawn on the "a" file.)} Qh6 41.Kh3
