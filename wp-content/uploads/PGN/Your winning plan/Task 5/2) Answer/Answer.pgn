{Normally we should keep the tension and play Be3. However in this position it
is good for white to close the position: 1)  the black's bishop b7 is on the
wrong place; 2) it is difficult for black oto prepare the move f5, while white
will attack on the queen-side without any problems. It determines white's huge
positional advantage. This calls "deep understanding of chess". You can see that it is very simple actually.} 9.d5
