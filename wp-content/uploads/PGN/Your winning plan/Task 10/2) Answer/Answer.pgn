thing he can do really. Secondly black should find the best positions for all

the objects of the white's attack. Secondly we should think HOW to realize this
plan. White should put his heavy pieces on the "d" file to attack the d6 pawn,
and white should push his queen-side pawns to attack on the queen-side. Since
we have a dynamic center white should play slowly and realize his plan
thoroughly.  When you understand this strategic content, you will understand all the white's moves easily.} 20.Rd3

{White has an advantage on the queen-side, so he should play there. The knight
should go to the c5, the bishop - to the diagonal h2-b8 and also it will be
good to exchange the dark-squares bishops; the "a" pawn should go forward. Here is the white's plan.} 23.a4

{though black can play c5, it is a risky decision, because white will attack
those pawns (d5, c5, b6) then. At the same time black has quite good control
over the central squares now, which make it possible for him to transfer an attack on a side.} 15...g5
