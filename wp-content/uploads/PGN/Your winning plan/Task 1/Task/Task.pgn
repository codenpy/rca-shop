1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.Bc4 Nf6 4.d3 Nc6 5.c3 g6 6.h3 Bg7 {
(In an early opening stage you should rather orient on the general strategic
principles and main opening's tasks. That's why you should not really compose a plan here.)}
7.Bb3 O-O 8.O-O {
(Black has made all the obligatory moves. Now it is time to compose a
middlegame plan. The central position has not been defined yet, that's why the
classical plan is an attack in the center. Black can play e5, Be6, d5 and so on.)}
b5 {(In this game black chosen another plan - the attack on the queen-side. It is a
normal plan also, because black controls the center good enough and white can't get any progress there.)}
9.Re1 a5 10.a3 {
(This is a pawn move, so black should make adjustments in his plan. Now white
creates weaknesses on the light squares of his queen-side. Black will try to use it somehow.)}
a4 11.Bc2 Nd7 12.d4 {
(another pawn move and another signal for black to make corrections in his
plan. Now white has clear weaknesses c4 and b3 and black should try to occupy them.)}
Nb6 13.Bd3 c4 14.Bc2 Na5 15.Bg5 Nb3 16.Bxb3 axb3 17.Qc1 Na4 {
(Black got an advantage on the queen-side and it is impossible to continue
playing there. Now (when white player is thinking) black should create a new
plan. "If you can play in a center - do it". We may not ignore the center for
so much time, that's why black definitely should play there.)}
18.Bh6 Bxh6 19.Qxh6 f6 20.Qc1 e5 21.Re3 Ra7 22.Nbd2 Re7 23.Nf1
Bb7 24.Qd2 f5 25.exf5 gxf5 26.N1h2 e4 27.Ne1 f4 28.Re2 Bd5 29.Rd1
{(Black got a domination in the center and the situation became stable. Now black should think about his plan again.)}
Rg7 {(One of the ways of using your central advantage is to transfer an attack on a side.)}
30.f3 e3 31.Qc1 h5 32.Nf1 Qd7 33.Kh2 Rf6 34.Qb1 Rfg6 35.Qc1 Nb6
36.Qa1 Nc8 37.a4 {
(After the white's pawn move black should make adjustments in his plan. Black
may decide to use his extra pawn on the queen-side or just to resume the attack on the king-side.)}
bxa4 38.Qa3 Ne7 39.Ra1 Bc6 40.Qb4 Kh7 41.d5 { (Black should make one more note: "Now I can also push my pawns in a center d5-d4")}
Nxd5 42.Qa3 Ne7 43.Rd1 d5 44.Qc5 Nf5 45.Qb6 Nh4 46.Qb8 Rxg2+
{ You can see that only a few times during this game it was necessary for black
to compose a plan. In other positions black should play quickler.} 0-1
