attacks the c4-pawn, but it's also threatening h7 at the same time. This is
happening because White's pieces are more active than Black's.} (22. Bf4 $5) (

to create a strong pin over the h5-d1 diagonal. However, his king is still in
the center and if White plays accurately, he can claim the advantage. The
first move is obvious and very strong, h3. The idea is to eliminate the pin
drastically by exchanging pieces.} (10. Qa4+ $5) (10. Nb5 $5 e4 11. h3 $14)

reaction, the material is not so important here. More important is to complete
the development and start a direct attack against the enemy king.} exd4 13.
Re1+ {Black is a pawn up, but he has great difficulties to complete his
development. The bishop on e7 will be pinned and Black cannot connect his
rooks. White can increase the pressure against this bishop on e7, creating
more problems for Black.} Be7 14. Bb4 Ng8 15. Ba5 Qa6 16. Nxd4 {White not only
regains the material, but is also preparing Nf5 to increase the pressure
against the bishop on e7. Please also notice Black's queen poor position; c5
is on the cards as well...} Kf8 17. Nf5 Bg6 18. Nxe7 {Every good positional
game should end up with a tactical blow. White found the blow against the
pinned piece on e7.} Nxe7 19. Qb4 Re8 20. Rxe7 $5 {The best move was Bd8, but
Rxe7 is another practical choice.} (20. Bd8 $1) 20... Rxe7 21. Bd8 1-0

two pieces for the queen. However, White is threatening Ne6 and Nxb7. Black's
problem is that his pieces are not coordinated. Thus, White should be in a
hurry to do something right now, using the fact that Black's pieces are not
creating threats just yet.} Rde8 25. Nxb7 e4 26. Rd1 $16 {White has a clear
