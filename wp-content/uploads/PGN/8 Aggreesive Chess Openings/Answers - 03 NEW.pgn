sacrificed a pawn for central control and attacking opportunities. All the
circumstances are ready for the Greek Gift Sacrifice on h7. The idea is to
destroy the Black's king shield of pawns and then, lure it to the center of
the board.} (13. d6 $5) (13. Ng5 $5) (13. Qc2 $5) 13... Kh8 (13... Kxh7 14.

The position is complicated, but very interesting. White manages to activate
all of his pieces and now, it's time to do something with them. For that
