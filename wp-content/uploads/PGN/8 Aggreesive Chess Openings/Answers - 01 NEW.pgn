this position thanks to his space advantage, better development, and pressure
against the f7-pawn. He has many good continuations, but he chooses the most
aggressive one: to open lines immediately with f5.} (17. Qg8+ $5) (17. Be3 $5)

shows how dangerous is to open lines on the kingside because White has a very
strong attack. The enemy king is in the center of the board.}) 18. fxg6 $1 {
This is an amazing move, isn't it? White sacrifices his queen temporarily in
order to promote his pawn.} Nxg6 (18... Nxh7 19. gxh7 $18 {White is winning
here because he can create a new queen.}) 19. Be2 Ba6 20. Bh5 $18 {Black's

some attacking possibilities.} Rac8 24. Qb4 {White cannot play Qc3, so he
tries for another route; Qd4 is on the cards. Similarly, the d6- and b7-pawns
