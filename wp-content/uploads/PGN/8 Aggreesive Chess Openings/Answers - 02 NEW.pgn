{The position is dynamically balanced, but Black found a very interesting way
to open up lines against the enemy king. This knight sacrifice in the center
of the board helped Black to activate the b7-bishop. Did you manage to spot
this idea?} (20... Nfxd5 $5) (20... e4 $5) 21. cxd5 Nxd5 {Suddenly, the
position changed and Black has the upper hand because he can create problems.
Right now, he is threatening a strong discovered check on e3.} 22. Kg1 e4 {
When you have the initiative, it's important to create threats. Creating
threats means that your opponent should reply to them. White is threatening e3.
} 23. Nxe4 Bd4+ 24. Rf2 $5 (24. Kg2 Qe7 {Black has tremendous compensation for
the piece sacrifice thanks to his powerful b7-bishop. White's king is not safe
in the long h1-a8 diagonal.}) 24... Rxf2 (24... Bxf2+ 25. Nxf2 Qf6 26. Qe1 Rae8
$17 {This was another way to continue the attack.}) 25. Nxf2 Qh4 {Of course,
this is the most accurate way. Black didn't capture the material because the
d4-bishop is powerful. White cannot defend now from the Rf8 deadly threat.
Carlsen won the game after some moves.} 26. Qe1 Rf8 27. Bf3 Rxf3 28. Qe4 Qxf2+

need to open lines and be ready to sacrifice material. The g4 move is
mandatory now.} 22. Nc6 Qf8 23. fxg4 hxg4 24. hxg4 Bg5 $1 {This is the part of
the plan. Kasparov foresaw that he should transfer the queen to the enemy
kingside. The queen can deliver very strong threats. Still, the position is
approximately balanced, but White should find unique moves to stay in the game.
} 25. Bf3 Qh6 26. Re1 Nh4 {The threat now is to capture the f3-bishop. It's
not hard to imagine that Black's position is very close to winning here. At
least, his attack is extremely strong because almost all of the pieces are
concentrating there.} 27. Bxh4 (27. -- Nxf3+ 28. Qxf3 (28. gxf3 Qh3 29. Qe2 Rh7

pawns, so the material is equal. After the forcing exchanges, the material
will be a rook and a pawn against two knights.} (39... Rxe4 $5) (39... Bc7 $5)
40. Bxc3 Ngxe4 41. Bd4 Qxd5 {Here, we should evaluate the position again.
Black has a fantastic control of the center. He is attacking the d4-bishop,
and potentially, he can create threats against White's king. Again, the long
h1-a8 diagonal is playing an important role.} 42. Bxc5 bxc5 {Another
transposition of the game. After this exchange, Black has a passed pawn, which
is more dangerous compared to White's a2-pawn. White's pieces are tied down to
the defense because the g2-rook has to block the long diagonal and the
e2-queen must protect the f2-square from potential knight checks.} 43. Qc2 Bh4

bringing more pieces to the enemy kingside.} 44. Rf1 c4 45. Rf5 Qd3 46. Rf4 (

Qc6 $1 {Black is a little better here because he is controlling the center of
the board. However, the d6-pawn is backward and, sooner or later, he should do
something about it. The d4-knight is important because it blocks the d-file.
So, Black used his activity to strike in the center.} (27... Qc8 $5) (27... Rc7

light-squared bishop in the long diagonal. The diagonal is completely closed
for the moment, but the e3-queen isn't a good blocking piece, and Black can
increase the pressure with Rg8. Black can also play on the other side of the
board because he can prepare the breakthrough with a4 or c4.} 31. Rg1 (31. Nxd5

with Rg8. Black can also play on the other side of the board because he can

typical breakthrough, but Black was well prepared for it. Mainly, Black would
like to play Nf3 and open the position for his bishops. Unfortunately, White
didn't have any other breakthrough or any other active plan in the position.}
33. Kh2 Nf3+ 34. Bxf3 exf3 35. Qd2 Rd7 $19 {The f3-pawn is there, covering
some important squares, the d7-rook is active and the position is open for the
bishops. Thus, we can conclude that Black has the advantage. Topalov manages
to win the game afterwards.} 36. Qc2 Qd6 37. Qc1 Qd2 38. Qxd2 Rxd2 39. Ncd1 Bh4

many black pieces are concentrated on the kingside, so they need open lines in
order to attack the enemy king.} 26. Nxg3 Nxh2 {When you sacrifice one piece,
you should not hesitate to sacrifice more... The idea is to pin the h2-bishop
and to create checkmate threats. Did you foresee this second sacrifice?} 27.
Bxh2 Qxg3 28. Kg1 Qxh2+ {After this combination, Black is a pawn up. This is
not the end of the story because Black can continue his attack.} 29. Kf2 Bg4 $5

to exchange some defensive pieces. It's not a piece sacrifice, as you can see
in the sub-variations. Polgar has a better position and she manages to win the
