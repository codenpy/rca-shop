ways to improve the position of his pieces and play positionally. However, the
enemy king is in the center of the board and, for that reason, White would
like to open the center as soon as possible. This is a pawn sacrifice, but the
opening of the b-line will help White pieces join the attack.} (12. Bd2 $5) (

two rooks in order to stop all of Black's threats on the queenside. The pawn
on f7 is dangerous and a potential new queen. White is controlling the center
very well and he has a nice outpost on e5. Thus, the position is better for
White.} (23. Qxf8+ $5) (23. Qxh7 $5 Rg4 $132 {White is better, but Black has
counterplay.}) (23. Qe7 $5 Rg4 $132) 23... Rxf7 24. gxf7 Bh6 25. Ned4 {We can
see now why White's position is better. The d4-knight looks great and White's
plan is g3, Rh1 and Rxh7. Black's king isn't in a safe location, but White
cannot attack it right now.} Nxe5 26. Nxe5 Qxd4 27. Rfe1 {Black performed a
nice combination in order to win a pawn, but still, White has a dominant
position. The plan remains the same: g3, Kg2, and Rh1. White wins the game

It's OK for Black to capture one pawn, but not two. He is behind in
development and White's pieces are extremely active. Black's main problem is
the king in the center of the board and weaknesses on the dark squares.} (13.

the weak g7-pawn, but the dark squares in general.} g6 15. Qd4 {Forcing Black
to play f6...} f6 16. Rxe6+ Kf7 17. Bf4 $18 {White's position is winning. We
can see that he has full dominance on the dark squares, finalized the

pieces. Areshchenko manages to win the game afterwards.} Qc8 18. Re3 a5 19.

the attack or strike immediately. When you have a lot of good options, it
means your position is very promising. With the last move, he has completely
opened up Black's queenside and White's active pieces can join the attack
rapidly.} (21. Rc1 $5) (21. Ra4 $5) (21. a4 $5) (21. a3 $5) 21... Nxa7 22. Qxb6
{The queen is protecting the escaping squares for the king. White's rooks are
coming to the c-file. Black's rooks and the g7-bishop cannot help with the
defense. Thus, we can claim that White created the strongest army on the
queenside.} Bc6 23. Rc1 Rf7 24. Ba6+ {White can give up the Exchange on c6,
but Ba6 is a more practical move. Movsesian manages to win the game afterwards
with this crushing attack.} (24. Rxc6+) 24... Kd7 25. Qxa7+ Ke8 26. Qxe7+ Rxe7

a4 $1 {Again, we can see the same scenario: Black's pieces are undeveloped and
White is controlling the center. However, Black has some threats and, for that
reason, good calculations are required. White calculated very accurately his
last move, a4. He sacrificed the Exchange in order to weaken the light squares
this time. The idea is to create an attack against the enemy king, which
stands in the center of the board.} (14. bxc4 $5) (14. Qf3 $5) (14. Bb2 $5)
14... c3 (14... Bd7 15. Nxc4 $18 {Black avoided the direct attack, but it is a
disastrous position for her...}) 15. axb5 Qxa1 16. Bc6+ {This is the point of
the combination. White is dominating the light squares and Black's king
position is very cramped.} Ke7 17. Qc2 $1 {This is the killing move because
White avoided the pin over the d-file and, at the same time, he's ready to
create problems for Black's queen. The threats are Nc4 and Bg5. White wins the
game after some moves.} Qa5 (17... cxd2 18. Qxc5+ Rd6 19. Qxd6#) (17... Nh6 18.

exchange his bad bishop for the opponent's good one. Short started a fight for
the dark squares. Black's problem is that he cannot create any counterplay on
the other side of the board, so this is a one-sided game.} (21. Ba5 $5) (21.
