very interesting and well-calculated move by Grischuk. The idea is to stop
Black's counterplay on the kingside. White is a pawn up, but in similar
situations, you need to eliminate the opponent's activity.} (31. Rc5 $1 {This
was the strongest move because it pinned the f5-pawn and immobilized Black's
pieces. A maneuver like Nf3 and Nh3 is on the cards. White is winning here.}) (

decisive attack against the enemy king.} (24. Rhe1 $5) (24. c4 $5) 24... Nxe5

in order to continue the attack and, at the same time, he performs a double
attack to the h6-rook and the e5-knight.} (26. Qc5+ $5) 26... Qf6 (26... Qh8

one...} Bxd4 (20... exd5 21. Rxe7 $18) 21. Nxe6 $3 {This was the real point of
the combination. White blows up the position and takes advantage of the
queen's bad placement on e7. The knight is untouchable and, at the same time,
he is threatening Nxd4, as you can see in the sub-variarions.} Ne5 (21... Rfe8
