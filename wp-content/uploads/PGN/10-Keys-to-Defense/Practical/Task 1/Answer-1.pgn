very important profylactic move in order to put the king into safety and
closer to his pieces. Black can create some threats on the long a8-h1 diagonal

all of the white pieces are participating on the attack; the a1-rook is out of
the game.} (18... fxg4 $4 19. Qxf7#) (18... d4 $1 {This is winning as well.}

creating problems to White because the knight is pinned and White doesn't
manage to perform his original plan. During the game, he overestimates his
position by sacrificing the rook on c8; but it wasn't the best idea.} 24. Rxc8

has the bishop pair and very active pieces that compensate for the lost pawn.})

woking now because Black can save the queen, pin the knight on d4 and protect
