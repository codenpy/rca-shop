back a pawn, but now he manages to activate the bishop to f5. The g4-pawn is
protected and the bishop joined the defense.} 25. exd4 Bxd4 26. Rxd4 $1 {Here
comes the real defensive sacrifice. White sacrifices the Exchange in order to
eliminate one very important atttacking piece, the dark-squared bishop. At the
same time, he'll manage to exchange queens and it means that the attack will
be over.} cxd4 27. Qxc6 Bxc6 28. Nxd4 {The material is equal, a bishop and 2
pawns for the rook; but White's pieces are extremely active and Black will
soon lose more material. Thus, White wins after some moves.} Ne5 29. Bxb4 Rgd8

Exchange sacrifice.} 1. Rg1 {It was a 960 game, and we can see that White is

compensation here because his light pieces are very nice positioned in the
center. The h4 move isn't dangerous because Black cannot use any file on the
kingside. White himself would like to open up the h-file and then jump there
with the queen.} (5. Qf2 $5) (5. Bf5 $6 Rxf5 6. gxf5 Rxf5 $15 {And step by
step, Black can prepare the g4 advancement. White should defend passively here.

attacking chances. Black's problem is the passive rooks and the h8-bishop.
These pieces doesn't have any good prospects. Now both pawns are under attack
-the h4 and a7! Both players had a time trouble here and this was a reason why
Caruana didn't defend correctly. The main point is that White made the
Exchange sacrifice early on and he managed to find good counterattacking
chances. White manages to win the game afterwards.} Qg7 7. Qxa7 Qe7 8. Kh2 R6f7

position is aproximately equal, but White should find counterplay in order to
equalize the position.} 19. Qg3 Nhg4 $5 {This is an interesting try; Black
