Qd5 $1 {Usually, in the Spanish, White would like to attack on the kingside;
in order to do that, he concentrates pieces there. Black has a lot of good
moves; however, the best way is to create the counterattack. He can achieve
that with the very active Qd5; the idea is to eyeball the g2-square. The
threat is to jump with the knight to d4.} (20... Kh8 $5) (20... h6 $5) (20...
Rab8 $5) 21. Bb1 Kh8 {Another very precise move. You need to calculate
correctly what is happening on the board and pay attention to your opponent's
threats. White not only defends against Nd4, but also prepares Ba2, pinning
the queen to the king.} 22. Ba2 Qxc5 {Till now, Black is a pawn up with a
better position. Calculation doesn't mean to foresee 10 moves ahead, but to
understand what is going on and don't miss the simple tactics.} 23. d4 Qd6 (
23... exd4 {This was preferable.}) 24. dxe5 Nxe5 25. Rad1 Qc5 {This situation
is a little complicated now because White has compensation for the sacrificed
pawn. In order to avoid the situation, you should calculate ahead what is
going on. For that reason, 23...exd4 was preferable. Black is very lucky
because he can create a counterattack by threatening the a2-bishop or
checkmating on g2.} 26. Be3 Qxc3 27. Bd4 (27. Rc1 Qb2 $1 {Just in time, Black
has this counterattacking move because the a2-bishop is hanging. Thus,
everything is under control.}) 27... Qc6 {Black has a slight advantage, but

because the e6-knight is pinned. Similarly, he is threatening to capture the
b7-pawn, and this is the hidden threat. In a similar situation, you should try
to use counterattacking ideas and spot the opponent's hanging pieces. Qa4 is
doing that job!} (15... Qa4 $1 {This is an excellent idea, offering some
chances to fight back. The hidden resource is to capture on f5 with the bishop
and, after that, deliver a double threat on a5.} 16. f5 Bxf5 $1 17. Nxf5 Qa5+

to use this pawn as a shield. Similarly, he could block the g-line with Bg6.
Black should base his counterplay on his central pawns. In any case, Black is
facing problems because his king is under heavy pressure. Black is on the
defense. Black's idea with Qc7 is to overprotect the g7-pawn. As you can see

variation.} (22... Qxc2 $4 23. Rxg7+ Bxg7 24. Qg5 $18 {And Black can only
