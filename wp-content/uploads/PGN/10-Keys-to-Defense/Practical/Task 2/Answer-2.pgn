the pieces, Bf5! In reality, he would like to capture on g5 immediately, but
the f8-rook will be under attack; as you can see the sub-variation. Thus, he
first played bishop to f5 in order to connect the rooks and then capture on g5.

manages to stop all of the direct threats and now he's two pawns up. White
still has some compensation and the position is dynamically equal; but Black
managed to consolidate and win the game afterwards.} 25. Be4 Qf8 26. Qh3 d2 27.
