gives White enough compensation for the pawn. The material is not always
important but the initiative is; and White definitely has a strong initiative.}

important piece, the only truly developed piece which controls squares on the

White would like to double the rooks on the d-line. That being said, White's
last move has two scopes, two roles to serve.} a6 20. Rh3 Qe7 21. Bd3 {
