b5 {Diagram #} Nd4 $3 {This is a brilliant sacrifice in order to open lines
against the enemy king. It's impossible for Black to calculate all of the
sequences, but this sacrifice should be right because White's army is
undeveloped.} (15... Na5 $5 16. e4 {

The rook is under attack and, at the same time, Black has freed the f3-square

for that reason, they cannot help the king or organize a defense.} 18. O-O-O $1

Rxh1 Qd5 $1 {Double attacks win the game. The queen is threatening the rook on
h1 and the knight on c5. Please, note that the c5-knight is not totally
unprotected, but the queen on c2 is overloaded; it should defend both the
knight and the e2-bishop. Black has a winning position and Garry manages to
convert his advantage at the end.} 20. Re1 (20. Rg1 $2 Rxe2 $1 21. Qxe2 Qxc5+

the initiative means to create threats for your opponent.} Qc5 15. c4 $1 {
This is a typical move which keeps the initiative for White. In most of the

we might sacrifice material, for example a pawn, in order to win tempi and

is not interested in the draw, but it's always good to know that you can draw
the game whenever you want. White's plan is to play h4, h5, e5, Nd6, Ne4 and
then Be4. This is a possible way to bring all of the pieces into the attack,
