this game in the next 20 moves. After the game, in one interview, he told that

diagram, Black manages to attack White's rook with the last d4 move. And now
it looks like White needs to remove his rook, after which, Black will get his
knight into play and the position will be equal. Nevertheless, White finds the
way to get the attack on the opponent's king, before he manages to develop his
pieces.} hxg5 19. hxg5 dxc3 20. Bf4 $1 {Incredible move! Black is a rook and a
minor piece up and White plays such a move. But this is the best move and the
example of how to get the attack going even when you have a material
disadvantage.} Kf7 21. Qg6+ Ke7 22. gxf6+ Rxf6 23. Qxg7+ Rf7 24. Bg5+ Kd6 25.

inside a mating net.} Qe5+ 27. Kf1 Kc6 28. Qe8+ Kb6 29. Qd8+ Kc6 30. Be4+ $1 {
Nice move and the end of Black's hope. He resigns because of the mate. Great
attacking show from Topalov! He calculates everything correctly and manages to
mate the opponent's king. A great example of how to get the attack going from
start to end without any mistake. Great game!} 1-0

$1 {In the position on the diagram, Black is a pawn up. But all White's pieces
are nicely placed and they can easily get close to Black's king. Because of
that, White can get a great attack on the opponent's king, but he needs to
calculate the consequences of this Nxg7 move correctly.} Kxg7 27. Qd4+ $1 Kf8
28. Bh6+ $1 {A great example of transformation of the position and the hidden
resources from the side which gets the attack going. Here White sacrifices the
knight in order to destroy the position of the black king and to bring all his
other pieces into a big attack. Now Black's king is without defense.} Ke8 29.
Re1 $1 $18 {And Black resigns because he is without defense. Nice example of
how to get the attack going. First, to sacrifice material in order to open the
position of the opponent's king and then to bring all the other pieces to get
a deadly attack on the opponent's king.} 1-0
