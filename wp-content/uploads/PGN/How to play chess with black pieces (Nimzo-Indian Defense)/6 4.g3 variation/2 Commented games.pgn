has managed to exchange his 'a' pawn for White's 'c' pawn - a fact that is
highly useful in the middlegame for Black, as he shall have more central

more conservative and better than e4.}) 16... d4 17. Nb5 g6 {Supporting b5
becomes difficult now!} 18. Qe2 {The b5 knight is now pinned. What will you do:
play e5 or is there something better?} d3 $1 {Tactical awareness is the key to
a good chess ELO!!} 19. Qxd3 Rd8 20. Qe2 Rxd2 21. Qxd2 Qxb5 $19 {Black is

mentioned in the note to Black's 5th move. This is the position of hot debate
these days. Surprisingly, in this position the knight on c3 doesn't have any
good squares to go to. It's best to just sacrifice it and to get on with our
development.} Nc6 {I recommend this simple developing move. Any attempt to
save the c3 knight just gives White an advantage.} (9... Na4 10. a3 Be7 11. Nb5

the open 'b' file and the strong g2 bishop are testimony to that. But he has a
weak c4 pawn, too; and even if he wins back the pawn, he can be structurally
worse. I think Black is not worse in this position, but the next few moves
have to be extremely precise to rob White of his initiative.} O-O $6 {0-0 was
not the priority in this position: the optimum positioning of the queen and
dark-squared bishop is what Black needed to think about. Now White gets his
compensation rolling.} (13... Bc5 $1 {Is the best move here. You can make this
move only if you can understand that the most important thing in this position
is not the safety of the king but the right positioning of the Black pieces to
neutralise White's initiative.} 14. Bxb7 {Taking back the pawn seems most
logical.} (14. Rb5 {Trying to continue like Rogozenco did in the game, but it
just falls short.} Qc7 15. Bf4 (15. Rd1 d6 $1 {So as to meet Bf4 with e5.})
