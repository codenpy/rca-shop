1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. g3 (4. Nf3 c5 5. g3 {Transposes into the main
line in this section.} (5. e3 {Transposes to e3 lines.})) 4... c5 5. Nf3 cxd4
6. Nxd4 Ne4 {In order to defend the c3 knight, White has now two options: Qd3
is the main line and the recently popular Qc2.} 7. Qd3 (7. Qc2 {For many years
this was considered a mistake. But now it has become a very popular move.} Qa5
8. Bg2 $1 {This is the best move in this position. He is ready to sacrifice a
pawn so that he will have a very strong bishop on the g2-a8 diagonal.} (8. Qxe4
Bxc3+ $15) (8. Ndb5 {Is another option available to White, but I think it is
hardly any good.} a6 9. Qxe4 axb5 10. Bd2 bxc4 11. Qxc4 Nc6 12. Bg2 d5 {Black
has comfortably equalised and is maybe even slightly better. Check the game
Lehmann-Miroschnichenko for more analysis.}) 8... Nxc3 9. O-O $1 {Surprisingly,
the knight on c3 doesn't have any good squares to go to.} (9. bxc3 Bxc3+ 10.
Bd2 Bxd2+ 11. Qxd2 Nc6 $15 {Is clearly in Black's favour.}) 9... Nc6 {I
recommend this simple developing move. Any attempt to save the c3 knight just
gives White an advantage. All these moves of the Black knight are analysed in
the game Rogozenco-Fish.} 10. bxc3 (10. Nxc6 dxc6 11. bxc3 Bxc3 12. Rb1 O-O $11
{White has an extra pawn and this time his lead in development is not so
threatening, because the bishop on g2 has been blunted by the c6 pawn.}) 10...
Bxc3 11. Nb3 Nd4 (11... Qe5 {Is an option that is analysed in our illustrative
game.}) 12. Nxd4 Bxd4 (12... Bxa1 13. Nb3 $18) 13. Rb1 Bc5 $1 {Is the best
move here, the analysis of which is done in the game Rogozenco-Fish.}) 7... Qa5
8. Nb3 (8. Qxe4 Bxc3+ $15) (8. Bd2 Nxc3 9. Nb3 {Is a mere transposition.} Ne4
10. Nxa5 Bxd2+ 11. Qxd2 Nxd2 12. Kxd2 Nc6 13. Nxc6 dxc6 $11) 8... Nxc3 9. Bd2 (
9. Nxa5 Ne4+ 10. Bd2 (10. Kd1 Nxf2+ 11. Kc2 Nxd3 $19) 10... Bxd2+ 11. Qxd2 Nxd2
12. Kxd2 Nc6 13. Nxc6 dxc6 $11 {And here I cannot believe that Black can be
worse. He is equal and it can be an interesting endgame.}) 9... Ne4 $1 10. Qxe4
{This is the only way for White to fight for an advantage.} (10. Nxa5 {Is
again no good.} Bxd2+ 11. Qxd2 Nxd2 12. Kxd2 Nc6 $11) 10... Bxd2+ 11. Nxd2 O-O
{Black completes his development. White, on the other hand, needs to play Bg2,
defend the d2 knight and only then can he 0-0. In the meantime, Black will
develop his pieces and capture the centre.} 12. Bg2 Nc6 13. Qe3 (13. Qd3 $5 {
Is an interesting option for White, but not played so often.} d5 $1 {Black can
play in an energetic fashion to gain the initiative in this position.} 14. cxd5
exd5 15. Qxd5 {Taking the pawn seems like the most principled reaction but
also the one that involves a lot risk because White has not 0-0 yet.} (15. O-O
Be6 {Leaves Black with an isolated pawn, but not with any problems as he is so
active.} 16. Nb3 Qb6 17. Rfd1 Rfd8 18. Rac1 Rac8 $11) 15... Qb4 16. Qb3 Rd8 $1
17. Rd1 (17. Qc3 $5 {Is not an easy move for White to make.} Be6 18. Bxc6 Qxc3
19. bxc3 bxc6 20. Kd1 Bf5 21. f3 Rd7 22. Kc1 (22. e4 Rad8 $17) 22... Bg6 {So
as to meet e4 with f5.} 23. Rd1 (23. e4 f5 $1) 23... Re7 24. e4 f5 $132 {Truth
be told, to play with the White pieces requires immense precision. He has an
extra pawn but piece coordination is poor. While Black has to make natural
moves and keep positing problems for White to solve, I think black should not
be unhappy with his position. And how many people can find 17.Qc3!? A
computer-like move!}) 17... Qa5 18. Qa3 Qxa3 19. bxa3 Nd4 20. Rc1 Bg4 21. Bxb7
(21. e3 Rac8 $11) 21... Rab8 22. Bf3 Bh3 $44 {White is in some trouble here.
He cannot easily develop and Black pieces are very active. Black has full
compensation for the two pawns.}) 13... d5 {We continue naturally and break in
the centre.} 14. O-O d4 15. Qd3 e5 (15... Rd8 {Is another opportunity, but I
like this normal play with e5.}) 16. a3 f5 17. b4 Qc7 $13 {With a very
interesting game.} *
