1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. Qc2 {This is one of the most critical
variations in the Nimzo Indian. The main advantage of this move is that White
wants to get the bishop pair without ruining his pawn structure. Of course, if
he gains something, he also loses something; and in this case he is losing
time and falling behind in development, which Black can take advantage of by
developing as quickly as possible.} O-O $1 {Now White has two choices. the
very popular a3 and the aggressive e4.} 5. a3 (5. e4 $5 {Is very interesting.}
d5 6. e5 Ne4 7. Bd3 c5 8. Nf3 (8. Nge2 {Now we can just take on d4 and
transpose into the main line - or we could play something different just so
that you have two choices.} Nc6 9. cxd5 exd5 10. O-O cxd4 11. Nxd5 Qxd5 12.
Bxe4 Qxe5 13. Bxh7+ Kh8 {Is the very interesting position that you can reach
out of this opening.}) 8... cxd4 9. Nxd4 {Leads to the main position analysed
in the game Mekhitarian-Mareco.} Nd7 10. Bf4 Ndc5 11. O-O Bxc3 12. bxc3 Bd7 $5)
5... Bxc3+ 6. Qxc3 b5 $1 {The Adorjan Gambit named after the highly original
player Andras Adorjan. The main point of this move is to open up the position
before White can develop his pieces.} 7. cxb5 (7. Qf3 {A surprising move - but
if Black knows what to play, then Black will take the initiative.} Nc6 (7... c6
{Is a possibility.}) 8. cxb5 Nxd4 9. Qxa8 Nc2+ 10. Kd1 Nxa1 {Black has the
advantage.} 11. Qxa7 c6 $44) 7... c6 8. Bg5 $1 {This move, pinning the knight,
is a very unpleasant one.} (8. bxc6 Nxc6 9. e3 Bb7 {Followed by Rc8 and Na5
will give Black more than enough compensation.}) (8. f3 $5 {White is trying to
build a strong centre but Black now has a very powerful move...} Nd5 $1 9. Qd3
cxb5 10. e4 Nb6 {And in the game Karpov-Ghaem Maghami, Black was able to play
excellently and won the game. This game is analysed in quite a lot of detail.})
(8. e3 cxb5 9. Bxb5 Ne4 {Followed by Nd6 and Ba6 gives Black a very good
position.}) (8. Qg3 {Was played against me recently by a strong IM. I think it
only has surprise value. Objectively, moving the queen again is not such a
good idea.} Ne4 9. Qd3 d5 $11 {I think Black has a very good position.} 10.
bxc6 $2 Ba6 11. Qc2 Qb6 {With Rc8 coming up and Nc6, Black has very
threatening activity.}) 8... cxb5 9. e3 Bb7 10. Nf3 h6 11. Bh4 (11. Bxf6 Qxf6
12. Be2 Rc8 13. Qd3 a6 14. O-O Nc6 15. Rfc1 Na5 16. Nd2 Bd5 17. b3 Rxc1+ 18.
Rxc1 Qe7 19. b4 Nc4 $11) 11... a6 12. Bd3 Nc6 13. O-O Rc8 $11 {Is analysed in
the game Zhukova-Hunt. This position holds a lot of possibilities for both
sides, but I think Black is totally fine. CONCLUSION: the general thing that I
would like to say about the pawn sacrifice with b5 is that there aren't many
variations. It's more important to know the ideas and typical motifs of
creating counterplay. If you know that, then you can be confident even if your
opponent produces some novelty; and the way to learn this is to keep seeing
many games in this line and trying to guess the moves of the Black player 
(good players).} *
