White's king side development! Have a little laugh and ask our opponent
whether he is brave enough to open the position?} 7. cxb5 c6 8. bxc6 $6 {I
think taking the pawn is not such a good idea. It basically leads to a
position where all the initiative is with Black. White is a pawn up but will
have to play very accurately to reach a position where he can take advantage
of the extra pawn.} Nxc6 9. Nf3 $6 {I don't like this move. This gives Black
an opportunity to post the bishop on a6. As a result, whenever White plays e3,
he will lose the chance of 0-0.} Ba6 $1 {Developing the piece to an active
square and freeing the c8 square for the rook.} 10. e3 Ne4 $1 {The knight on
e4 is a good piece to have. Black already possesses a huge initiative.} 11. Qc2
Bxf1 12. Kxf1 f5 {In this way, Black anchors his knight on the central square.
Later maybe, he can use the f6 square for a rook lift from f8; and now the
idea is also to infiltrate via the 'c' file, whereas White is quite passive
and has really not many active plans.} 13. h4 $6 {White wants to exchange the
knights from g5.} Qa5 {Clearing the way for the rook to come to c8, if it
would like to; also the queen stands quite well on this square.} 14. Ng5 Nb4 (
14... Rac8 {Would have been better.} 15. Nxe4 fxe4 16. Qxe4 $2 Qb5+ 17. Kg1 Na5
$19 {With the knight coming to b3, queen coming to e2 and both rooks on open
files, Black's position is a picture of complete domination.}) 15. Qe2 Nd5 {
The two knights have taken up central posts on light squares. You will realise
that in this opening Black is usually following a light-squared strategy, i.e.
to put all his pieces on light squares, as the light squares are so weak.} 16.
Nxe4 fxe4 {The d5 knight is far far superior to the c1 bishop.} 17. Bd2 Qb6 (

over, as the queen has no good square to go to.} 21. Qc4 (21. Qg4 Qb5+ 22. Ke1

rook is hanging and so is the bishop on c3. What a powerful game by
Miroshnichenko! One of those games which makes you believe in the power of the
move b5 followed by c6.} 0-1

system. The main reason is that White is saying, 'I don't mind if material
equality is established, but I don't want to be passive - I want my bishop to
be active on the g5 square'.} cxb5 9. e3 Bb7 {Black develops without losing

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. Qc2 O-O 5. e4 {This move has become popular
recently. It is a very aggressive and captures the centre. Black has no time
to play positional chess now, as he has already castled. So I think the best
reaction is to strike in the centre.} d5 $1 6. e5 {This is the only logical
move that White has.} Ne4 7. Bd3 c5 $1 {Black keeps on hitting White's centre.
In the lines with Qc2, we often see very energetic play by black because he is
trying to profit from the lead in development that he has over White's other
advantages. White has four choices here: 1. Nf3; 2. Nge2; 3. a3; 4. cd5. One
small note would come in handy here. After Nf3 and Nge2, White has the choice
of taking on d4 and both will convert to the same line - which is the game
continuation. But to Nge2, I have suggested one more option for Black - if
ever you want to use it...} 8. Nf3 {Now we have to take on d4, as Nc6 doesn't
work so well because the e5 pawn will be protected by Nf3.} (8. Nge2 Nc6 $5 {
This is played less frequently, but I think it is a very interesting move.} (
8... cxd4 {Of course, we can merely convert to the main line by taking here on
d4, but it doesn't hurt to have an extra choice just in case you want to try
something different some day.}) 9. cxd5 exd5 10. O-O (10. a3 cxd4 $1 11. axb4
Nxb4) 10... cxd4 11. Nxd5 Qxd5 12. Bxe4 Qxe5 13. Bxh7+ Kh8 {Everything was
almost forced up to this point. What do we have here? Black has a passed 'd'
pawn in return for his h7 pawn. Black's king is a little weak now. But it all
boils down to this fact: how well does Black make use of his d pawn? Black has
active pieces, too, so I think this position is very interesting!} 14. Bf4 Qf6
15. Be4 Re8 $1 {I like this move because now the rook is putting pressure on
the e4 bishop and, at the same time, on the e2 knight which is defending Bf4.
All in all, then, it's a very useful move.} 16. Rac1 Ba5 $1 {This is a great
move! The bishop will relocate to b6, where it will defend the d4 pawn very
well.} 17. Rfd1 $2 {At first glance, this is a natural move; but actually this
position is so imbalanced that it's really tough to play accurately.} Bb6 $1 {
Already Black has many threats - Nb4, Bg4 sometimes d3! White is now in bad
shape. Here is just an illustrative line.} 18. Bg3 (18. a3 Bg4 $1) 18... Nb4
19. Qb1 Bg4 20. Rd2 d3 21. Bxd3 Nxd3 22. Qxd3 Rad8 23. Qb5 a6 24. Rxd8 Qxd8 $19
{Black wins a piece. Though this was just an illustrative variation, it shows
us how the play can flow in such positions.}) (8. a3 {This move has the
drawback that White will lose the right to 0-0.} Bxc3+ 9. bxc3 cxd4 10. cxd4

Nc6 12. Ne2 f6 $1 {Opening up the 'f' file where the White king resides.} (
12... Nb4 $6 13. axb4 Qxa1 14. f3 $44 {Is just the kind of compensation that
White is looking for.}) 13. Bxe4 dxe4 14. exf6 (14. Qxe4 fxe5 15. dxe5 Qxe5 $15
) 14... Rxf6 {In return for the bad pawn structure, Black has good squares for
his pieces and White a bad king placement. This position is unbalanced but
Black has his chances. The first thing is that White cannot take the pawn on
e4.} 15. Be3 (15. Qxe4 $6 Qa4 16. Bg5 (16. Qd3 Nb4 17. Qd2 Nc2 18. Ra2 Ne3+ $1

some players, but I consider it's just equal.} dxe4 11. Qxe4 Qa5 12. O-O Qxe5

compensation for the exchange.}) 10... Ndc5 11. O-O Bxc3 12. bxc3 Bd7 $5 {This
is a very tricky move. Its idea is twofold: one is to control the a4 square so
that Na4 or Ba4 becomes possible; and the other is to play Rc8 quickly and put
pressure down the 'c' file.} (12... Nxd3 13. Qxd3 b6 {Is the main line.}) 13.
Be2 {This is the main move.} (13. Nb3 Nxd3 14. Qxd3 Rc8 15. f3 (15. cxd5 Nxc3

pawn.} 14. cxd5 exd5 15. c4 {This seems like the most logical move in this
position.} (15. f3 Nexc3 16. Bd3 h6 {Black is better.} 17. Qd2 Qb6) (15. Bd3

Kc3 Bf1 {The line with 5.e4 is quite complicated; but if you are ready to play
the main line with d5 followed by Ne4 and c5, and you know what is going on,
then White cannot really count on an opening advantage.} 0-1
