The pin is highly uncomfortable.}) 10. O-O Ba6 11. f4 f5 (11... Na5 12. f5 $5 {

moves in the position; ef5 is another one.} g6 {Keeping things steady.} 13. Be3

board.} cxd4 $1 14. cxd4 {White has got everything he wants: good development,
two strong bishops and a strong centre. As for the last one, is it really
strong?!! Karpov asks the same question with his next move!} d5 $1 15. cxd5 {
This looks pretty forced.} Bxd3 16. Qxd3 (16. dxc6 Bxf1 {Is simply bad for
White.}) 16... fxe4 $1 {An intermediate move that simply blows White's proud
centre apart.} (16... exd5 $2 17. exf5 gxf5 18. Nxf5 {White is just a simple
pawn up.}) 17. Qxe4 Qxd5 18. Qxd5 {The queen trade is practically forced.
Black has made White's structure disintegrate. White would really love to
avoid the queen exchange here, as positionally he is not so well-off.} (18. Qd3

keeping a complete hold of the centre.}) (18. Rac1 Rc8 19. Qxd5 (19. Rc2 {

something that White would see in the worst of his nightmares.}) 19... exd5 {
Transposes to the game.}) 18... exd5 {So let's take stock of what has just
happened. 1. Black is left with two knights against White's bishop and knight.
The c6 knight is well placed and the other knight is ready to jump to d6 and
probe the weak e4 and c4 squares. 2. White has a horrible dark-squared bishop
on e3 at the moment. It is the prime reason why Black is worse in this
position. 3. one more factor in Black's favour is the 2-1 queen side pawn
majority; it will be very useful in the endgame. If we assess all these points,
we definitely come to the conclusion that Black must have a small edge.} 19.
Rac1 Rc8 20. f5 $1 {This makes total sense to me: removing a pawn from the
dark square should be one of the prime concerns for White before Black can
play Nd6 and prevent f5.} Nd6 21. fxg6 hxg6 22. Rxf8+ Kxf8 $15 {Suffice to say
at this point, the opening has gone very well for Black. he has a small
advantage if White plays accurately, but it's so difficult to play as White
here that slowly Black's advantage will grow in size - as Karpov showed in
this game.} 23. h4 (23. Ne2 {To defend the d4 pawn was necessary.} Nc4 24. Rc3
Ke7 25. Bg5+ Kd6 26. Rg3 Re8 27. Kf2 {Threat is now Bf4.} Kd7 {And now Black
can play a5-b5 and try to create a passed pawn on that wing. Remember that
White is still a little inferior here. As Yusupov made a mistake, Black's
advantage immediately became decisive.}) 23... Nc4 24. Bg5 (24. Bf2 Nxa3 $17)

h5 pawn is going to do the clean-up work, i.e. to push the knight away.
Black's compensation also lies in White's poor pawn structure and the e3
