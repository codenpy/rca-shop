1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. f3 {The move f3 denotes the Saemisch
Variation. As in the King's Indian Defence, White moves his pawn to f3 in the
hope of building a strong centre. But against the Nimzo Indian, it isn't
possible because Black plays right in the centre and prevents White from
building a huge pawn phalanx. The game will be complex and interesting, but
will be in no way worse for Black.} d5 $1 {Not a typical Nimzo move, because
most of the time we avoid moving this move and rather choose the 'c' pawn. But
here it makes total sense, as White has played his pawn to f3; this means that
his knight can no longer develop on f3 and he falls back in development -
hence the break in the centre makes full sense.} 5. a3 Bxc3+ 6. bxc3 c5 7. cxd5
Nxd5 {I recommend this move order for a safe game. It's very solid and Black
gets a very good position after it. His winning chances, according to me, are
not many - but his losing chances are even less. I recommend the more
combative ed5 if you are in a must-win situation.} (7... exd5 $5 8. e3 {Since
the game Botvinnik-Capablanca AVRO 1938, this structure has been long
considered to be bad for Black. White has a simple plan: he puts his bishop on
d3, then the knight goes from e2-g3, 0-0 and then White executes e3-e4, by
which stage he has the two bishops and mobile pawn centre. However, we stop
that plan right in its tracks with the very interesting move...} (8. Bg5 O-O 9.
e3 Re8) 8... c4 $1 {We shall analyse this position in our illustrative game
Kasparov-Polgar.}) 8. dxc5 {This is the only way for White to play in the f3
Saemisch. He gives up all the positional considerations on the queen side, so
that he can build up a strong centre and use his two bishops. Black, on the
other hand, will have a compact structure and will not face too many
difficulties in neutralising White's initiative.} (8. e4 Nxc3 9. Qd3 cxd4 $19)
8... Qa5 {Putting pressure on the c3 and c5 pawns.} 9. e4 $1 {This very strong
move shows White's intent - that he is ready to sacrifice a pawn if that means
making his dark-squared bishop even more active.} Nf6 {I recommend this simple
knight retreat. The knight can later come to d7 and the other knight could go
to c6 or a6. As White has pawn deficiencies and weakish squares on the queen
side, these two knights will play an important role in trying to exploit these
weaknesses.} (9... Ne7) (9... Nc7) (9... Qxc3+ $2 10. Bd2 $19) (9... Nxc3 10.
Qd2 Nc6 11. Bb2 Na4 12. Qxa5 Nxa5 13. Bxg7 {White has a better position.}) 10.
Be3 O-O (10... Qxc3+ 11. Kf2 {Is definitely what white wants. Black has
established material equality but the pawn on c3 was just a thorn in White's
side. After it's gone, he can use his rook and bishops to greater advantage.})
11. Qb3 (11. Kf2 {Followed by Rb1 or the other way around is a sideline, but
the ideas are pretty similar. We shall examine the game Volkov-Bruzon Batista
and analyse it in depth to understand what's going on here.} Nfd7 12. Rb1)
11... Nfd7 12. a4 $5 (12. Qb4 Qc7) 12... Qc7 {Now Black threatens to take on
c5.} (12... Nxc5 $2 {Is a mistake, as it allows White to straighten his pawn
structure after...} 13. Qb4 $1 $16) 13. Qa3 (13. Qb4 Nc6 14. Qa3 b6 $5 15. cxb6
axb6 16. Bb5 Ba6 {Black has an excellent position.}) 13... b6 $1 {This is a
typical pawn sacrifice for this variation. Accepting the pawn sacrifice is not
so good, as it opens up two files - the 'a' and the 'c' file - for Black, on
which he can attack the weak White pawns.} 14. a5 $5 {This move is the most
challenging for Black to meet.} (14. cxb6 axb6 {How Black equalises with ease
in this position is seen in the game Ipatov-Fedorchuk.}) 14... bxc5 (14... Bb7
{Was tried by Kramnik, but I see nothing wrong with taking the pawn back.}) 15.
a6 {This is the latest try by White to secure an advantage in this position.
Ling Diren was able to beat the super solid Leko in this line with White. So
we must be careful. But I think inherently there is nothing wrong with Black's
position.} (15. Nh3 {After this move Black uses the a6 square and obtains an
excellent game - as shown in Cebalo-Zelcic.} Ba6 16. Bxa6 Nxa6 17. Qa4 c4)
15... c4 16. Qa5 Nb6 17. Nh3 e5 {Black has an equal game, as shown in our
illustrative game Berry-Maki Uuro.} *
