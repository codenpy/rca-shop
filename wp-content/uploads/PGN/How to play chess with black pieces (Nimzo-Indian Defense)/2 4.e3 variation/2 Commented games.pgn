{I would say this is the game that ignited my love for the Huebner wall with
the c5-d6-e5 structure against the 4.e3 Rubinstein system. This game is so
beautifully played by Bobby Fischer that I must say just delving into this
game thoroughly can elevate your understanding of chess to a whole new level!}

that here we can take on c3 - as the knight is not so well placed on f3 - then
we can place our pawns on the opposite-coloured squares of our remaining
bishop.} Bxc3+ 7. bxc3 d6 8. e4 e5 9. d5 Ne7 (9... Na5 {Is not so good here
because White can play...} 10. Nd2 b6 11. Nb3 Nxb3 12. axb3 {When White's pawn
structure has been strengthened.}) 10. Nh4 (10. O-O $6 {Allows Black to
execute his h6-g5 idea.} h6 11. Nh4 g5 {Is not so good for White. It is
explained in the note to White's 11th move.}) 10... h6 $1 {The point of this
move is to prevent f4. If White makes a move like 0-0, then g5 will stop f4
forever.} 11. f4 $1 {Spassky backs himself up and is even ready to sacrifice
material for the initiative.} (11. O-O g5 12. Nf5 (12. Qf3 Nfg8 {Is an
interesting idea.} 13. Nf5 Nxf5 14. exf5 Qf6 15. g4 h5 $1 {With the knight
coming to e7 and king moving to d8-c7, this position holds a lot of promise
for Black.}) 12... Nxf5 13. exf5 e4 14. Re1 Bxf5 15. f3 Qe7 16. fxe4 Bg6 {Now

Spassky could have delayed this exchange of pawns, but who could resist the
temptation of giving the opponent an isolated pawn and getting a passed pawn
for oneself?} dxe5 14. Be3 {I had a friend with whom I played a lot of blitz
games in this position. He believed in the strength of White's position and I
was of the opinion that Black is better. So we played a lot of games and they
usually continued this way.} (14. O-O O-O 15. Rb1 b6 16. a4 a5 $1 17. Rb2 Bd7

Qxf7+ Kxf7 {And it might seem that this position is equal, but in fact it's
almost lost for White because his main weakness - c4 - can be defended by his
bishop but both Black minor pieces can attack it: Nd6 and Ba6. White will have
his work cut out to secure a draw and I must say that I have won tons of such
endgames against my friend.}) 14... b6 15. O-O O-O {Let's take stock of what
we have in this position: 1. White has a passed pawn on d5; 2. White has the
bishop pair; 3. Black has an isolated pawn on e5; 4. Bd3 is a real bad bishop;
5. the c4 pawn is a little weak. All in all, we can say that apparently White
looks better and it seems that he has a small edge. But Fischer shows that
it's Black who holds all the long-term trumps.} 16. a4 a5 17. Rb1 Bd7 18. Rb2
Rb8 19. Rbf2 Qe7 20. Bc2 g5 $1 {Black intends Qe8-g6 and then Nh5, with the
double rook exchange that, as we know, favours Black.} 21. Bd2 Qe8 22. Be1 Qg6

losses are inevitable.} 0-1

good position on the king side.}) 10... Bd6 $5 {What is the logic of this
move? The idea is to pressurise h2 and the queen can come to h4 if White does
nothing about it. Hence it's just a provoking move. Most of the times White
meets it with Ne4, which reduces the pressure on the d5 square.} 11. Ne4 Be7

The start of the plan introduced by Ivanchuk. His rook will come to d8 and
then he will play g6 and transfer his bishop to g7 from either f8 or f6. In
this way, he will put pressure on d4 to a great extent.} 13. Qd3 Rd8 $1 {As
cool as a cucumber, Ivanchuk figures out that White really has no good
prospect of attack with his knight and hence doesn't waste time with some
precautionary move.} 14. Ng5 (14. Nd6 $2 g6 (14... Bxd6 15. Qxh7+ Kf8 16. Qh8+

excellently placed. I like Black's position: he can later plan Bc6-b5 - as
Gelfand did in the game.}) 15... Bf6 16. Rd1 Bg7 17. Bb3 h6 18. Ne4 Nce7 {

weak d4 pawn. One must not be afraid to change the central structure, i.e. to
take back on d5 with a pawn.} 20. Nxd5 exd5 $15) 19... Nxc3 $1 {Ivanchuk
decides to change the structure drastically. But now the weakness is no longer
the d4 pawn - soon it will be the c3 pawn.} 20. bxc3 (20. Nxc3 Nf5 21. d5 Qb6

Nge2 is from the start a little inferior, because I personally prefer the
knight on f3 than on e2 in an isolated queen pawn structure. Moreover, with
Ivanchuk's plan of pressurising the d4 pawn with Qc7 and Rd8, I think, more
often than not, White lands in a positionally inferior position which is a
delight to play from Black's side.} 35. Bc6 0-1
