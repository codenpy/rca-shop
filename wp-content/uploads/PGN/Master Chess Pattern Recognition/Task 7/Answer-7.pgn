$1 {White's pieces are very active and White can complete his development
naturally. On the other hand, Black has the bishop pair, but the center is
blocked and the rook in the corner is unprotected. Firstly, you need to spot
these tactical nuances and, then, you may try to explore them. Deflection is
an amazing weapon that helps you do that: you can remove the key defender by
force in order to disorganize the defense.} (13. O-O $5) (13. Be3 $5) 13...
