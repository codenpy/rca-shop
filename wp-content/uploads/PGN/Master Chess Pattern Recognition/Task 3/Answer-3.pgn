One of the most typical chess patterns is to place your rook on the seventh
rank. In order to fight such very active pieces, you need to attack or
exchange them. This is exactly what the great World Champion Magnus Carlsen is
doing; he's challenging the rook by his rook.} (25... Ne2+ $5) (25... Rae8 $5)
26. Rxe8+ Rxe8 27. Ra1 $6 (27. f3 $1 $132) 27... Rd8 {Black's rook is faster
and it can create technical problems to White's back rank. Similarly, Black
can play Rd2 and, then, Nd1 in order to attack the f2-pawn. Unfortunately,
White cannot coordinate his bishop and rook; so, he cannot create huge
problems to White.} 28. Bf1 c5 29. Ra3 Nb1 $5 {A very nice maneuver because
Black is driving the knight to the weak f3-square. This powerful knight, close
to the enemy king, is higlighting the back rank issues.} 30. Ra1 Nd2 $1 31. Be2
Nf3+ 32. Bxf3 exf3 $17 {Black has a clear advantage because his rook is very
active on the d-line and he can find some targets on White's pawn structure;
more specifically, on c4 and f2. White's rook is active on the a-line; however,
it cannot find an easy target to attack and it should protect the first rank.
For that reasons, Black has a clear advantage and he manages to win the game
afterwards.} 33. h3 h5 34. g4 fxg4 35. hxg4 h4 36. Kh2 Rd2 37. Kh3 g5 38. e4

to create an amazing pressure against Black's queenside. As you can see, all
of White's pieces are active and perform a task, by attacking something. The
only inactive piece is the bishop on b2, a piece that he would like to
exchange with the bishop on g7. Please also notice that Black's queenside is
undeveloped. For the above-mentioned reasons, White has compensation for the
sacrificed pawn.} (16. d5 $1) (16. Bc3 $5) (16. Rab1 $5) 16... Qb6 17. e4 $5 {
You may think to play immediately d5 and, definitely, this is a move that
Aronian calculates for a second. However, strong masters are not in a hurry
and they would like to straight his position before taking any tactical action.
The e4 is a free tempo move that decreases the activity of Black's rook.} (17.
d5 $5) 17... Rf8 18. Bc3 {This is another tempo move. As you can see, even
with these small almost inconspicuous looking moves, White manages to improve
his piece's activity. Please pay extra attention to this technique because all
of the strong players use it frequently. Implement this technique in your
games and boost your performance!} Qc7 19. Qb2 {What should we learn from
Masters? They are not in a hurry. Aronian has total control over the position
and, for that reason, he stabilizes it. Similarly, he's attacking the b7-pawn
and forces it to move from its initial position. After that, the g2-bishop is
becoming stronger and it has possibilities to attack the c6 in the future.} b6

This is a very optimistic sacrifice and Carlsen overestimates his attacking
possibilities. Yes, White has extremely active pieces, but the c6-bishop
cannot participate in the attack. At first glance, it looks extremely
dangerous, but Black can refute White's attack with a precise play. Thus, it
was better to play Rd8 and use the offsite queen on a2.} (25. Rd8 $1) (25. c5
