Bg4 9. f3 Bc8 10. Bxc4 c6 11. Qb3 e6 12. Nge4 {Diagram #} Nd5 $1 {It seems
that Black has some difficulties in order to develop his pieces, especially,
the light-squared bishop. Did you spot White's threat? White is threatening to
capture on f6 and, then, to play Ne4. By attacking the queen or bishop, he
will win a tempo and, then, he will place the knight on the perfect d6-square.
In the light of that, Black played Nd5. The knight is on a perfect square
there and he's hoping to improve his pawn structure.} (12... Nbd7 13. Nd6 $36)
(12... b5 $6 13. Be2 {And the c6-pawn is extremely weak.}) 13. Bxd5 cxd5 {Now
Black has the c6-square available for his knight.} 14. Nd6 Nc6 $1 {Black
speeds up his development at the cost of the pawn. It's more important to
finalize your development and invite your opponent to use time in order to
capture the b7-pawn with the knight. This pawn will create tactical problems
to White.} 15. Nxb7 Qh4+ 16. Bg3 Qh6 {Black starts the counterattack; the
e3-pawn is under attack.} 17. Ne2 (17. Bf4 Nxd4 $1 18. Bxh6 Nxb3 19. Bxg7 Kxg7
20. axb3 Bxb7 $15) 17... Bxb7 $1 {A very nice move because Black would like to
win tempo by attacking the queen and placing his knight on the fantastic
c4-square.} 18. Qxb7 Na5 19. Qb4 Nc4 $132 {Black here has sufficient
counterplay with the knight and he is threatening both e3 and b2. I say b2
because Black would like to play with tempo Rfb8 and, then, to capture on b2
with the knight.} 20. Rxc4 dxc4 21. Kf2 Rfc8 22. Rc1 Bf8 23. Qa4 Qg5 24. Rxc4

15. Qxc2 dxc5 16. Qxa4+ Qd7 {Diagram #} 17. Ne5 $5 {White can achieve the same
results with a different move order, but this is the cleanest one. He is
attacking the queen and, immediately, driving the knight to c4. Next, he will
play Nd2 and Nb3, and will double the rooks on the a-line.} (17. Rd1 $5) (17.
Nbd2 $5) (17. Qxd7+ $6 Nxd7 {Stoping Ne5 and helping Black develop his pieces
better.}) (17. Qa5 $6 {There is no need to keep the queens on the board. It's
not easy to press the a5 with the queen in front of the rook.}) 17... Qxa4 18.
Rxa4 Bd6 19. Nc4 {The knight achieved its dream square, in front of the enemy
pawn; so the rooks cannot attack it. Similarly, it's attacking the d6-bishop,
and Black should treat him.} Bc7 20. Nbd2 {The other knight is driving to b3
in order to increase the pressure against the a5. All of White's pieces have a
clear scope and initiative. Please notice that Black is behind the development.
} Ke7 21. Rea1 a5 22. Nb3 {The computer evaluates the position as equal, but
White has a tremendous pressure against the a5-pawn. The f6-knight is out of
the game and it's looking for a good square. White manages to win the game
afterwards.} Nd7 23. Nbxa5 Bxa5 24. Rxa5 Rxa5 25. Rxa5 e5 26. Kf1 h5 27. h4 Rb8

cxd5 9. O-O O-O {Diagram #} 10. f3 $1 {White improved his pieces' positions,
and now it's time to improve the pawn structure. The light-squared bishop on
g2 is buried behind Black's pawns, and White should do something about that.
Similarly, White would like to open the f-line in order to attack Black's
kingside and have access to the f5-square.} (10. Kh1 $5) (10. a3 $5) (10. Bf4
$5) 10... exf3 11. Rxf3 Nc6 12. Nf5 {White has very active pieces, as you can
see. More specifically, White brings into life and gives scope to the bishop
on g2 and the knight on c3.} Ne4 13. Rf1 Bf6 14. e3 Nxc3 15. bxc3 Be6 16. Rb1 {
Before taking any actions, White improves the position of all of his pieces.
This is how masters approach the game; they're not in a hurry.} Qd7 17. e4 $1 {
A very nice move in order to attack the center and maintain the knight's
fantastic position on f5.} Rfe8 18. Nh6+ {A nice blow! Balck cannot capture
the knight because the f6-bishop is hanging. After that, White continues his
attack brilliantly and manages to win the game afterwards.} Kh8 19. Rxf6 gxf6
