Be2 Nc6 9. d5 Ne5 10. Bd4 {Diagram #} c5 $1 {In the Grunfeld defense, Black
should counter attack the enemy center. White usually stays with the king in
the center, in order to occupy it with the pawns. This gives the opportunity
to fight immediately in the center. If White manages to stabilize it and
complete the development, then Black might have problems. For that reason,
Black tries to take advantage of White's delay in development. Of course, the
best way to create threats is by attacking moves!} (10... f5 $5) (10... c6 $5)

weakest point, the a1-h8 diagonal and, more specifically, the c3-knight.
Tactics are very useful in order to boost forward our strategical ideas. He
sacrificed the knight in order to create a powerful pin against the queen and
king; because the king is still in the center.} 14. Qxb2 Qc7 (14... Qa5 15. Bb4
$1) 15. Bb4 (15. Be3 Bxc3+) 15... a5 {After this forcing continuation, Black
will get back the piece because the bishop is trapped. White doesn't have
other alternatives, as you can see in the sub-variations.} 16. Nge2 axb4 17.
Qxb4 Bg4 {This is another threat; it's important to see and understand that
Black develops his pieces with threats. Right now he's threatening to capture
on e2 because the a1-rook is hanging.} 18. f3 Bd7 19. O-O b5 {Black has very
active pieces and the bishop pair. The a2-pawn is a potential weakness and
it's not obvious where White can create counterplay. After a long fight, Black
manages to win the game.} 20. Kh1 Qd6 21. Qxd6 exd6 22. Rab1 Rfb8 23. Rb4 Ra3

better development and manages to attack the enemy king in the center. However,
in this particular game, White plays slowly and Kasparov grabs the opportunity
to open the center for his benefit.} (16... O-O $5) (16... a5 $5) 17. exd5 Qxd5

This is a very strong move because it's grabing more space on the queenside
and it's threatening b5. Unfortunately for Black, he cannot capture on b4
because of the discover attack, Rxc6; and White will win material.} (20. Re3 $5
