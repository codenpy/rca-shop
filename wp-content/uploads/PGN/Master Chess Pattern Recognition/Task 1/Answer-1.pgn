15. Ng3 Bb6 16. Qe4 {Diagram #} Bd7 $5 {The position is about equal. We can
see a typical position with an isolated queen's pawn on d4. White has more
space and more active pieces, but Black's position is solid. Black needs to
develop his remaining army, Bc8 and Ra7. For that reason, he played Bd7.} (
16... Rb8 $5) (16... a5 $5) (16... Qb4 $5) (16... a6 $5) 17. h4 Be8 {This is a 
clever move because Black brings more pieces to the kingside. The bishop frees
the d-line and liberates the d7-square; thus, Black can double the rooks on
the d-line.} 18. a3 Rd6 19. Qg4 Rad8 {Now White starts feeling very
uncomfortable because Black's pieces are well-coordinated and his pawn
structure is solid. Please also notice that White is missing his dark-squared
bishop and, for that reason, he doesn't have any sacrifices or tricks on h6.
Black's pieces are pressing the isolated d4-pawn and White should find active
moves in this difficult situation.} 20. d5 Qf8 $1 {Magnus is overprotecting
the g7-square and is ready to capture the d5-pawn. The c6-knight is
untouchable thanks to the pin over the d-line; the d1-rook isn't protected
very well.} (20... a6 21. Re1 Rxd5 22. Bxd5 Rxd5) 21. Qe4 Ne7 {The isolated
d5-pawn is doomed and Black will capture it soon. Magnus manages to win after
some moves.} 22. Bd3 f5 23. Qe5 Nxd5 24. Bxf5 exf5 25. Nxf5 Rc6 0-1

thanks to White's initiative on the e-line. However, a closer look is needed
in order to understand better the position. White doesn't have any good
discovered attack with the e7-bishop, and the b3-bishop is out of play.
Similarly, we can see another problem; White has double pawns on the f- and
c-lines. Black's b7-bishop is very passive, but this is a temporary problem.
Black needs to activate the bishop and, then he will claim the initiative.} (

active his b3-bishop, but Black wasn't interested in opening lines there.
Black improved the bishop position and now he has the initiative. He cannot
kick away the e7-bishop, but he is threatening to play a5 and liberate his
a8-rook. Black has a better position and Kramnik manages to win it afterwards.}

so, I didn't ask you this move; it was easy to find it. However, it is
important to decide where you'll place this bishop in the future. Right now,
with the Rad8 move, Black is creating the threat to capture on b5 because the

we can create problems for sure.} 28. Kh2 Be8 $5 {Black is relocating his
bishop on h5 in order to continue pressing the f3-pawn. Please notice that he
relocates the bishop from this typical route because he would like to avoid
the Na7 move. Black's light-squared bishop can play an important role in
Black's initiative; so, he keeps it alive on the board.} (28... Bc6 $5 29. fxe4

close to the queenside. In general, in the king's Indian Defense, White is

keep close to the queenside, Black delays White's attack.} 18. Nh4 Bf7 19. Bd3

Black is forced to play this move in order to keep his rook active on the
d-line. Yes, the g7-bishop is closed, but everything in chess has pros and
cons. Black is controlling a lot of squares in the center and in front of his
king. However, the bishop on g7 is temporarily closed.} 17. Be3 Bf8 {Black
activates his bishop from another diagonal, a3-f8. Please also notice that b7
is continuously protected by tactical means: a fork on a5 with the knight.} 18.
Ke2 Be8 {I hope that you get it by now; this is a very typical pattern in the
middlegame and endgame. Black developed his bishop from c8 in order to connect
the rooks and, similarly, he put it on e8 in order to keep the d-line open.
The position is still complicated, but White is a little better thanks to his
space advantage. On the other hand, Black's pieces are also active and they
have possibilities to counterattack. After a long fight, Black manages to win
