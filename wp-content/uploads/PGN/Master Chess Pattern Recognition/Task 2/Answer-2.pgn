the players try to attack the flanks. White hasn't castled yet, but his king
is safe in the center because Black cannot attack it. Having the king in the

this move in order to block the h5 advancement. Then, he will play h4 and h5

White performed his attack faster and still Black's queenside pieces are

You need to think how to increase your activity and, at the same time, to
decrese your opponent's activity. White has a very nice grip on d5, and this
means that the d6-pawn will be a weakness. Before taking any immediate action,
White is decreasing Black's activity and exerts pressure on the e4-pawn.
Please also note that White has a queenside pawn majority and, if hesuccesfully
puches his pawns, then he can create a passed pawn.} (13. b3 $5) (13. Rd1 $5) (

similar position as in the previous example, in which Black has weakness on d6.
However, this weakness is protected very well with the e7-bishop. Yes, even
the passive bishops are doing a good work on the defense. Black performed the
strategical exchange, with the h5-knight and the f1-bishop. Please note that
the h5 advance isn't catastrophic for Black because, after h5 and hxg6, he can
recapture with f7 and protect the h7 with Rf7.} (16... Qc7 $5) (16... f6 $6 {

White's main problem could be the isolated knight on a5. White should protect
it with his pieces.} 21. Rh1 Rfe8 {The queen protects the 7th rank and the
rook frees the f8-square for the bishop.} 22. Qh2 Bf8 23. Bd2 Rc7 {Another prop
