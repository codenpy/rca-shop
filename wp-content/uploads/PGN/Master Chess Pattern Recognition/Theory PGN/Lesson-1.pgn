White is fully developed. As the rook on f1 might support f2-f4 it is good for
now. It is also hard to say where the queen is best placed, and in fact it is
quite fine where it is right now. Only the rook on c1 needs to be improved,
and b2 needs a little protection. Black, on the other hand, is in a bit of
trouble. Of his pieces, only the e6-knight and the bishop are really well
placed, although Black is considering ...a7-a6 and ...b7-b5 in the near future
in order to inject some energy into his pieces. But Black also has to respect
the weakness on d6. His only way to protect it is by exploiting his control
over d4. Therefore White should attack down the d-file with Rc1-c2-d2.} 15. Rc2
