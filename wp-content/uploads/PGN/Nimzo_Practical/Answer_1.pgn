attack directly to White's king, but he can combine strong threats in order to
exchange queens; as you can see in the subvariations.} (18... Nc6 19. h4 Ne7 {

move. Black should try this counterattacking move in order to save himself
from the deadly pin over the h4-d8 diagonal.} (23... Ned7 24. Nf5+ $1 gxf5 25.

This is a very cool attacking idea, using the fact that Black's queen is under
attack.} (24. Bxd8 Nxg3 25. hxg3 Rexd8 $19 {
White cannot capture on f7 and Black has a winning material advantage.}) 24...

behind it is that the h6-knight is protected.} Kh8 26. Bxd8 Rcxd8 27. Ng4 $16 {
The e5-pawn is under pressure and White would like to play the direct Re1,
kicking away the e4-knight, and then Nf6 to perform the Arabian checkmate.})
25. Rxf6 (25. Qb2 $1 {This was the best move, but difficult to calculate and
evaluate during the game...} Nxg5 26. Ng4 {White sacrifices a pawn, but he has
a fantastic pressure against f6. Thus, he has compensation.}) 25... Nxg5 $1 {
White missed that move. Black manages to eliminate White's strongest piece and
his dreams to complete his attack with success. Black survived thecomplications
and he manages to win the game afterwards.} 26. Rf7+ Kxh6 27. Qg7+ Kh5 28. Rf4
