some good ideas here. He selected a very nice positional plan, g5. This is
logical because the center is closed and Black's idea is to play Ng6 and Nf4.
This is a very agressive plan and White should do something right now.} (12...

{Black did not achieve the first play to place the knight on f4, but the pawns
are messy placed on the kingside. This is in Black's benefit because he has
possibilities to attack via the g-line.} 16. Qe1 h3 {A nice move; trying to
create problems with this h-pawn or to open up the g-file.} 17. gxh3 O-O-O 18.
Rf2 Nh5 {The knight would like to jump to f4 in the appropriate moment but, at
the same time, it creates a pivot square for the rook on g3.} 19. Rfb2 Rdg8+
20. Kh2 Rg3 $5 {This is a very interesting way to continue the attack. Black
is ready to sacrifice the queen on b7 in order to stop White's attack and then
continue with his own attack on the kingside.} (20... b6 $5) 21. Qe2 (21. Rxb7

Black has a winning position here with active pieces, which are ready to
increase the threats. He wins the game afterwards.} 23. Bf1 (23. Rxb7 Rg2+ 24.
