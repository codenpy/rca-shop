{The position is quite complex and unbalanced. Nevertheless, everything is
simple when you have a clear system of thinking. So let's use it.   We have 2
main endgame plans. First you should attack the opponent's weak pawns. Thus
black should attack the white's advanced pawns a5 and h6. Secondly, we should
use our passed pawns. Therefore black should advance his pawn majority in the
center and mainly the "e" pawn.   After that we come to the 2nd step of a
planning: how to use your pieces to realize these plans? Black found a get set
up in the game.} 23... Rc5 24. f3 Ke7 25. Kf2 Kd6 26. Re1 b4 27. Ra1 Bc6 28.

{Black should attack the white's weak pawns (c3 and d5) and use his pawn
majority on the king-side (mainly the "f" pawn).  The king should go in the
center (e5). It will attack the white's pawn d5 and will support the black's
king-side pawns.   The knight will go to e3.   The rook is active already and
there is no need to move it now.     Everything is very simple when you know
