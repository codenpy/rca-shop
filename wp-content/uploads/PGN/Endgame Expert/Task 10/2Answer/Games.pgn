10... Bd7 $1 {This paradoxical move is the best practical decision! There are
a few main arguments here:  1) 10...e6 is not good, because it loses a bishop.
2) In an endgame you should keep the pieces closely to each other to make them
more harmonic.  3) Black has no passed pawns. The only possible attacking plan
for black is to attack opponent's pawns. Probably black will try to attack on
the queen-side (where he has an open file "a"). Black will also need to push
the "B" pawn and that's why the bishop should be on d7.} (10... e6 $6 11. Nh4 {
