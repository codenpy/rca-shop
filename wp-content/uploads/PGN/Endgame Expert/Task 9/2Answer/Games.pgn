{Black has a little bit better position, because of the white's advanced pawn
b4 (which creates weaknesses).   At the same time white has a well-protected
position and it is very difficult for black to attack something really.   In
such situations you should use "an endgame Master's style": play slowly,
collect little advantages, make a lot of moves and create simple threats.}

torment his opponent instead. It implies 2 main things:  1) make a lot of
moves;  2) create simple threats.  Also it means that you should keep a

make something special to try to win the game by all means. Definitely not!
