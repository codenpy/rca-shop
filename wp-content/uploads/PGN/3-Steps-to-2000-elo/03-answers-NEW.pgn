the computer doesn't agree 100%. It's not difficult for Black to create a
kingside attack, White can play Kg2, Rh1 and he can press h6 pawn. Please,
also notice that the c6-bishop controls the important a8-square; so White can
fight for the a-file control.} f4 $6 (20... Qf6 $5) 21. Bxf4 {Black starts
over pushing! This is not a good and very characteristic strategy of amateur
players. You should not start attacking if you cannot create a stronger army
against the enemy kingside. In any case, White should be very careful here.}

center is stable. Black cannot do anything there, and White's pieces have
aggressive positions close to the enemy king. I'll mentioned it once again, in
opposite castles you need to create some counterplay on the other side of the
board. This is not possible right now, so Black's priority is to exchange some
pieces. You should trade your pieces with your opponent, but accepting the
sacrifices is extremely dangerous...} (16... Bxf5 $1 17. Nxf6+ Bxf6 18. exf5
gxf5 {White can win the exchange, but then the f6-bishop will provide good
support to the king; White's attack will be over. White is still better, but
Black might try to create counterplay later during the game.}) 17. Qg5 {
Black's position is terrible now. He has extra material, but he cannot defend
against all the threats successfully. The most obvious is the checkmate on g7;
the e5-knight cannot go to g6, and there is pressure on the e7-pawn. The Ng6
move is out of the list because the b3-bishop pins the f7-pawn.} Ng6 18. Bxg7 {
Low rated and amateur (lower to 2000) players always give some chances as
here! The Nxf6 move was winning, as you can see in the sub-variations.} (18.

such a position, you should spend time in order to understand what your
opponent wants to do and how to play against him. Black is in a little
pressure, but the position is playable for both sides. The last move, bd6, is
a tactical error; but it was very difficult to spot it during the game.} (19...
