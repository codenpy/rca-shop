Here is the critical moment for White because we have a lot of interesting

avoid all the tactical tricks and develop his queenside. Thus, we need a very

system, you need to play 5-10 prophylactic moves in order to stabilize your
position.} Nef6 (16... Nb6 17. Nxb6 Qxb6 (17... Rbxb6 18. Rfe1 $16) 18. b4 $16)

could play Ne5. After my move, Rfe1, I strengthened my position, prepared my
original plan e5, and it seems that Black was "running out" of moves. Black
didn't have tactics and active plans. I managed to win the game afterwards.} (
