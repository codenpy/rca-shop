{In the course "The Grandmaster's Openings Laboratory" you've learnt a good
way to play against Alekhine's defense. Now I'll show you another good
variaiton. It's quite unknown and will probably surprise your opponent.} 1. e4
Nf6 2. e5 Nd5 3. c4 Nb6 4. d4 d6 5. exd6 cxd6 6. Nc3 g6 7. h3 {Preventing
Black from playing Bg4 after White develops his knight to f3.} Bg7 8. Nf3 O-O
9. Be3 {In this line White postpones a development of his f1-bishop. Little
later we'll see why.} Nc6 (9... Bf5 10. Rc1 {will transpose into the main line}
) 10. Rc1 (10. Be2 {Is the classical line.} Bf5 11. O-O d5 12. c5 Nc4 {Now
White has to take the knight. This means White made 2 moves of his bishop (Be2
and Bc4), while it's possible to take on c4 in 1 move right from f1-square.
That's the reason why White postpones a development of this bishop in the main
line we are analyzing.} 13. Bxc4 dxc4 $11) 10... e5 (10... Bf5 {?!} 11. d5 Ne5
12. Nxe5 Bxe5 13. Be2 Rc8 14. Qb3 {White is threatening Nb5. Suddenly it's
quite hard for Black to stop this threat. There's 1 typical blunder here:} Nd7

(10... d5 11. c5 Nc4 {Now White takes on c4 in 1 move, without wasting time on
intermediate move Be2. That's the point of this whole variation.} 12. Bxc4 dxc4

a5-knight is trapped and White is threatening to play b4.}) (15... Qe8 16. b3
$14 {and Black's protected his advanced pieces}) 16. d5 Nd4 17. Ne1 {Black's
central pawns and pieces are hanging. It's going to collapse very soon.}) 11.

for Black} 12. dxe5 dxe5 13. Qxd8 Rxd8 14. c5 {forces Black knight to go back}

position}) 12. O-O Kh7 13. dxe5 (13. d5 {!?} Ne7 14. c5 {is good as well})
13... dxe5 14. c5 {Pushing Black's knight back} Nd7 15. Qa4 {White is going to
play Rfd1, then he can bring the knight to d6 through Ne4-d6 or Nb5-d6
maneuvers.} *
