1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nf6 {This Nimzo-Rubinstein variation can lead to very complex
positions. However, I'll show you a very simple way to deal with it, where you
don't need to learn any long lines.} 3. Nc3 {In most of the cases 3.Nc3 move
will convert it into the main lines of Sicilian defense.} (3. e5 Nd5 4. Nc3 {
This is the most ambitious way to counteract 2...Nf6 variation. It can lead to
sharp positions, and so it requres that you analyze the lines thoroughly. You
can find some good examples in the databse "2 Instructive games".}) 3... d5 {
That's the only real way for Black to avoid playing classical Sicilian defense.

After} 5... Nc6 {White can continue his usual development} 6. O-O e6 7. d4 {
with a good position}) 6. a4 {If you don't want to be involved into long
forcing lines, you can play this simple move 6.a4. Currently Black's d5-knight
is handing and he has to do something about it. On the next moves White is
going to continue his development: 0-0, d4. This gives White a slightly better
position.} (6. Ne5 {This is the main theoretical line, and it's a possible
alternative to 6.a4. However, you need to analyze these lines very well before
playing them.} Nf6 {This passive move gives White a comfortable position} (6...
