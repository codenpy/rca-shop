{Some players use the following plan against 1.d4, they play: f5, Nf6, e6, Bb4,
b6, Bb7. This may give an active position for Black. A student has asked me
how White should neutrlize this plan, and I'll show you a good way.} 1. d4 e6 {
(Here white can turn the game into French defense after 2.e4)} 2. c4 f5 3. g3 {
! This is the most precise order of moves. Now black can't play b6 nor pin the
White's knight after Bb4.} (3. Nc3 {llows black to pin this knight after} Bb4 {
then it will be simpler for black to occupy the e4 square with his knight.}) (
3. Nf3 {gives black a chance to place his queen-side bishop to b7} Nf6 4. g3 b6
5. Bg2 Bb7) 3... Nf6 4. Bg2 {Now black can't play b6. A move Bb4 makes no
sense, because there is no white's knight on c3.} Be7 {this is a passive
position for the bishop, but black has no better alternatives} (4... Bb4+ 5.
Nd2 {in the future white can play a3, which will force black to exchange his
bishop on the white's knight} O-O 6. Ngf3 d6 7. O-O {now Black's b4-bishop
appeared out of a game. White is threatening to play Nb3 and then to capture
the bishop by playing a3.} Bxd2 8. Bxd2 {White has an advantage thanks to his
2 bishops and better development}) 5. Nc3 O-O 6. Nh3 {White wants to leave an
open diagonal g2-a8 for his bishop.} d6 7. Nf4 {Black has a weak pawn e6 and
the white's knight puts pressure on it} c6 {Generally black wants to play e5.
However, first he needs to cover the d5-square, so that the white's knight
can't go there.} (7... e5 8. dxe5 {! this is the most powerful continuation,
which sets a sudden trap for black} (8. Nfd5 {!? allows white to trade
opponent's bishop and to get a positional advantage in a calm situation}) 8...
dxe5 9. Qxd8 Rxd8 {this natural move gives white a few extra tempos for the
attack} (9... Bxd8 {white has a sudden trick} 10. Ne6 {!} Re8 (10... Bxe6 11.
Bxb7 {winning material}) 11. Nxd8 Rxd8 12. Bg5 {white has a clear advantage.
Next white can take on f6 or play Nd5}) 10. Nfd5 {attacking the e7 and c7
squares, white gets the initiative position} Nxd5 11. Nxd5 Bd6 12. Bg5 Rd7 13.
O-O-O {with a huge advantage in activity}) (7... Nbd7 $2 {is impossible
because of} 8. Nxe6) 8. d5 {(Black was ready to play e5; White wants to break
black's plans.)} e5 (8... cxd5 9. cxd5 e5 10. Ne6 Bxe6 11. dxe6 {gives white 2
bishops and active position}) 9. dxc6 $1 {This powerful tactical idea makes it
possible for white to move his knight forward.} bxc6 (9... exf4 10. cxb7 {
winning material}) (9... Nxc6 10. Nfd5 {and White got an advantage thanks to
his strong knight and black's weaknesses}) 10. Nfd5 {White moves his knight
forward and is going to trade an opponent's bishop.} Be6 (10... cxd5 11. Bxd5+
{with a double attack on Black's king and rook} Nxd5 12. Qxd5+ {and Qa8}) (
10... Nxd5 11. Nxd5 {doesn't change much} Be6 12. Nxe7+ Qxe7 13. b3 {the
position is quite similar to the main line}) 11. Nxe7+ Qxe7 12. b3 {After that
White will play Ba3 and will put strong pressure on the black's central pawns.
Of course White should castle and place his rook to d1. In all of these lines
white can attack the black's center by playing e4, which is a good idea very
often.} *
