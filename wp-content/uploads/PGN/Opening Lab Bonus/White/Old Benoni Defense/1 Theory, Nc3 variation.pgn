{Here I'll show you how to deal with "Old Benoni defense".} 1. d4 c5 2. d5 e5
3. e4 d6 4. Nc3 {White doesn't play c4 in this line, because he reserves this
square for a knight.} Be7 {Now black wants to play Bg5 to exchange his bad
bishop.} (4... g6 {Black can develop this bishop to g7 but it doesn't change
much.} 5. Nf3 Bg7 6. Be2 Nf6 7. O-O O-O 8. Bg5 {When Black's bishop is on g7 -
White should play Bg5, pinning the knight. This is a prophylactic idea, which
makes it very difficult for black to start an active play on the king-side.} h6
9. Bh4 Nbd7 10. Nd2 {The knight is going to c4. Also White takes h5-square
under his control.} g5 {? this is a mistake, because it weakens a lot of
squares on the king-side.} 11. Bg3 Ne8 12. Bg4 {! This great move helps white
to exchange the light-squares bishops, which is in White's favor. In the
future White will play Nc4-e3-f5 and will occupy Black's weak squares.}) 5. Nf3
{White is developing the knight and is preventing Bg5 move.} Nf6 6. Be2 O-O (
6... Bg4 7. Nd2 {! This knight will be very powerful onto c4-sqaure. It is the
"key" piece in the white's set up. That's why White should play Nd2 to prevent
an eventual exchange of this knight. Additionally, this maneuver helps White
to trade light-sqaured bishops. This will make it easier for White to occupy
weak squares in Black's camp.}) 7. O-O Nbd7 (7... Nh5 {?} 8. Nxe5 dxe5 9. Bxh5
{Winning a pawn}) 8. Nd2 (8. Bg5 {Here it doesn't create a pin and may help
Black to trade off his passive e7-bishop.}) 8... a6 9. a4 {preventing b5} g6 (
9... b6 10. Nc4 {putting pressure on Black's weak pawns b6 and d6. After that
White will break through with either f4 or b4.}) 10. Nc4 Ne8 11. Bh6 {This
bishop can be developed to h6 or e3 squares in most of variations of this
opening.} Ng7 12. a5 {Fixing weak square b6 in the black's position. White's
main plan in this opening variation is to play Rb1 and b4 with an attack on
the queen-side.} *
