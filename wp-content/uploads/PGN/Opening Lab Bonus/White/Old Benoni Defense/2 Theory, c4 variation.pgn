1. d4 c5 ({Black can be tricky and use the following order of moves to reach
Old Benoni defense:} 1... Nf6 2. c4 c5 3. d5 e5 {Unlike the main line of "Old
Benoni", White has a pawn on c4. Hence he has to use another plan here. There
are a couple of good options for White, I'll show you 1 interesting line that
restricts Black's activity greatly.} 4. Nc3 d6 5. e4 {leads to the position
analyzed below}) 2. d5 e5 3. c4 d6 4. e4 Nf6 5. Nc3 Be7 6. Bd3 {Of course it's
not the only and not even the best move for White. However, it's a beginning
of an interesting plan that aims to limit Black's activity.} (6. Nf3 {is a
usual move. There's a small drawback: it closes d1-h5 diagonal for White's
queen and may allow black to play Nh5-f4 somewhen in the future.}) 6... O-O 7.
h3 {This move prevents Bg4 and (potentially) prepares g4 move} Nbd7 8. Be3 (8.
Nf3 {allows black to get some activity with} Nh5 {. A typical tactics} 9. Nxe5
{doesn't work here} Nxe5 10. Qxh5 Nxd3+ {And black is winning}) 8... g6 {Black
is ready to play Nh5, so White should prevent it.} 9. g4 {In addition to
preventing Nh5-move, this breaks the Black's plan of pushing f5 after a
required preparation.} Ne8 10. Nf3 {(preventing Bg5)} Ng7 11. Qc2 {White is
providing more control to f5 square. This set up of the pieces allows White to
prevent Black from playing f5. If necessary, White can also play Bh6 and Rg1
to make the f5 move totally impossible. After that White gets a very
comfortable position and can start realizing his own plans gradually.} *
