{There's one interesting plan in Dragon variation. You don't have to learn
many variations here. And you can confuse your opponent greatly.} 1. e4 c5 2.
Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 g6 6. Be3 Bg7 7. f3 a6 {In this system
Black is preparing the counter-attack on the queen-side first, and only after
that he makes castling. This makes it impossible for White to develop his
attack on the king-side straight away. In such a situation, White players
often get confused, and can't understand what to do.} 8. Bc4 (8. Qd2 {No
matter if White develops his bishop on c4 or not - Black's moves remain the
same.} b5 9. O-O-O Bb7 {then Nbd7 and Rc8.} 10. g4 {If White plays g4, Black
can either resume his normal development Nbd7 or stop the pawns' advancement
with a move h5.} h5 (10... Nbd7 {!?} 11. g5 Nh5 {this knight is blocking
white's "h" pawn.}) 11. g5 Nfd7 {Black has closed the king-side position. Now
he can castle safely.}) 8... b5 9. Bb3 (9. Bd5 {exchanges off the bishop and
doesn't give anything in return.} Nxd5 10. Nxd5 Bb7 11. Qd2 Nd7 {Black always
can push away White's d5-knight by playing e6.}) 9... Bb7 10. Qd2 Nbd7 11.
O-O-O Rc8 {This is a classical set up of Black's pieces in this variation.} 12.
h4 (12. Bh6 Bxh6 {It forces White's queen to go on the edge.} 13. Qxh6 Rxc3 14.
bxc3 Qc7 {White great attacking chances on the queen-side.}) 12... h5 {This
move stops White's king-side pawns. Then Black has several ideas: 1) Nc5-b3; 2)
Ne5 (or b6)-c4; 3) b4 and a5-a4. In any case Black is developing his attack on
the queen-side and only after that makes castling. This trick makes Black's
attack more quick and therefore more successful.} *
