{There's one interesting and relatively unknown variation in Dragon. If you
know that your opponent plays the main line of Dragon variation for White, you
can use this "secret weapon" against him. As we discussed in the main part of
the course, you should be ready to play ANY opening in a certain particular
game. Hence you may play this line of Dragon sometimes, even if you don't play
it usually.} 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 g6 6. Be3 Bg7 7.
f3 O-O 8. Qd2 Nc6 9. Bc4 Bd7 10. O-O-O {This is the main line of the Dragon
variation. Usually Black plays Rc8 here. However, you can suddenly use "a
Benko-like gambit".} b5 {It is a positional sacrifice to open the lines for an
attack on the queen-side. Additionally it gives Black several extra tempos for
development of his attack.} 11. Bxb5 (11. Ndxb5 Ne5 {Black goes Ne5 after any
move of white} 12. Bb3 Qb8 {Black is making all the moves with tempos.} 13. Nd4
Rc8 {Now Black has quite strong concentration of his pieces looking at the
White's king. Black is intending to play a5-a4 and Nc4 with a strong attack.})
(11. Ncxb5 {this move doesn't change anything} Ne5 12. Bb3 Qb8 13. Nc3 Rc8 {
and it is the same position}) 11... Ne5 {It is important for Black to save
this knight, because it is going to c4-square, which is a really powerful idea
for Black. From c4, the knight will attack a lot of squares in White's camp.}
12. Be2 (12. Bxd7 {This move helps black to develop his queen and loses the
defender of c4- square.} Qxd7 {Now Black wants to play Nc4, Rab8, Rfc8 with a
strong attack. The Black's attack is more powerful than the White's attacking
ideas on the king-side. That's why Black should ignore the White's plans and
focus on his own attack.}) 12... Qc7 {connecting the rooks and preparing Nc4.
The next black's moves are Rab8, Rfc8, Nc4 with an attack against White's king
(using the open files).} 13. Bh6 {This typical move is a mistake in this
position, because it moves away White's queen from the queen-side.} (13. g4 Be6
{an important move: 1) Here the bishop looks onto White's castling 2) it
provides d7-square for a retreat of his f6-knight 3) it covers d5-square.} (
13... Rab8 {?} 14. g5 Nh5 15. Nd5 {now we can see why it was necessary for
Black to play Be6 previously})) 13... Bxh6 {Black forces White to move the
queen aside, where it is out of game.} 14. Qxh6 Rab8 15. h4 Rfc8 {Similar to
Benko gambit, Black sacrificed a pawn to get open files on the queen-side.} 16.
h5 Rxb2 {Counterblow! In Dragon you should always try to make counterblows;
passive defense usually doesn't work.} 17. Kxb2 Qxc3+ {Now it becomes obvious
why it was better for White to keep his queen on d2. White's king does not
have enough defenders. White is lost.} *
