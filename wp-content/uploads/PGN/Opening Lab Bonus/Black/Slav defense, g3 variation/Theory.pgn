1. d4 ({In your games this variation can arise through this order of moves:} 1.
Nf3 Nf6 2. g3 d5 3. d4 {Now you have a choice. You may play 3...e6 getting a
Catalan opening (it's analyzed in the main part of the course). Alternatively
you may turn the game into a good variation of Slav defense.} c6 4. Bg2 Bf5 {
it's a transposition into the main line presented below.}) 1... d5 2. c4 c6 3.
Nf3 Nf6 4. g3 Bf5 {Black is going to play e6 (to free his f8-bishop), and so
it's better to put the c8-bishop in front of his pawn chain.} (4... Bg4 {
allows White to play} 5. Ne5 {with a tempo}) 5. Bg2 e6 6. O-O (6. Nh4 {loses a
pawn} Bxb1 7. Rxb1 Qa5+ 8. Bd2 Qxa2) 6... Nbd7 {It is better to develop the
knight first, because the knight has the only good square for a development,
while f8-bishop can go to different squares. According to the general rules,
we should develop knights before bishops.} 7. Nc3 (7. Nh4 {Black has a few
good ways to deal with the move Nh4. Hence Black should not be afraid of this
move.} Be4 {This intermediate move forces White to play f3, which will close
g2-bishop and will weaken White's position.} (7... Bg4 {!?} 8. h3 Bh5 9. g4 Ne4
{this counterblow helps Black to save his bishop and to put the knight on a
good square.} 10. Nf3 (10. gxh5 {?} Qxh4 {and black will capture White's
h5-pawn}) 10... Bg6 {Black saved the bishop; Nh4 idea failed.}) 8. f3 Bxb1 {
here black can win a pawn} (8... Bg6 {(Bb1 is good only because it wins the
pawn. Otherwise, Black should go Bg6. After an exchange black will have a new
open file "h")} 9. Nxg6 hxg6 {=}) 9. Rxb1 dxc4 {Black is up a pawn and has a
good position.}) 7... h6 {This prophylactic move provides a retreat path for
Black's light-squared bishop in case if White plays Nh4.} 8. b3 {Black can
take c4-pawn at some point, that's why White needs to protect it.} (8. Nd2 Be7
9. e4 dxe4 10. Ndxe4 Nxe4 11. Nxe4 Nf6 {leads to an equal position}) 8... Bd6
9. Bb2 O-O 10. Qd2 Qe7 {From e7-square the queen supports an eventual move Ba3
or a central advancement e5.} (10... dxc4 {In some positions Black can attack
White's c4 pawn suddenly.} 11. bxc4 Nb6 12. c5 Nc4 {this counterblow is a key
idea of the whole operation} 13. Qc1 Bc7 {Using this tactics Black were able
to capture White's dark-squared bishop.}) 11. a3 {White is preventing Ba3 move}
(11. Rad1 Ba3 {Black should play Ba3 if possible: 1) for lack of space it is
good for black to trade the pieces; 2) it may help Black to attack White's
weaknesses on the queen-side.}) 11... a5 {This move prevents White from
playing b4 and fixes White's weak pawn a3. This may help black to attack on
the queen-side in the future.} (11... Rad8 {This move prepares an active play
in the center. Black has developed all his pieces, and now it is time to start
an attack. Black can try to attack on the queen-side or in the center. Both
plans are possible.} 12. h3 dxc4 13. bxc4 e5 {This is a standard way for Black
to attack in the center.}) 12. h3 Ne4 {This exchange is good for Black
generally, and it is especially useful when Black is trying to attack on the
queen-side.} 13. Nxe4 Bxe4 {Black still has 2 main plans: 1) attack in the
center with the move e5; 2) attack on the queen-side by making the moves a4,
dc, Nb6 and so on} *
