{In the course "The Grandmaster's Openings Laboratory" you've learnt 1 good
system for playing against King's Indian attack. Now I'd like to show you
another good line.} 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d3 {Quite a lot of players use this
way of getting King's Indian attack. However, it gives you an additional
possibility. Here it's important for you NOT to have a knight on f6.} d5 4.
Nbd2 Nc6 5. g3 {The main White's plan in this opening is to get a space
advantage on the king-side by pushing his pawn to e5. After that White can
develop his king-side attack.} Bd6 {The point of Black's plan is to get a
strong control over e5-square and not let White to move his pawn there. In
this case White will not have any active plans.} 6. Bg2 Nge7 {Black develops
his knight on e7 with dual purpose: 1) Black can play f6 when necessary 2)
Black can play Ng6 is required. Both ideas prevent White from playing e5.} 7.
O-O O-O 8. Re1 (8. Nh4 b5 $1 {This is the most energetic way for Black. White
does not have any real threats, and so Black should not waste time on defense.
Instead Black can start his own attack, which will reach the goal much faster.}
9. f4 c4 {Although it seems like White is expanding on the king-side, in fact
it's very hard for White to create any threats. Most of White's pieces are
standing backward and can't support his attack. If necessary, Black always can
play f6 (or f5) and block White's pawns. At the same time Black should not
care too much about defense, his own attack is going quickly. Black is ready
to open up a position and to attack White's weaknesses.}) 8... Qc7 {Once again
Black doesn't give White a chance to play e5. At the same time Black develops
his queen.} 9. Qe2 (9. c3 Bd7 10. Qe2 f6 {is a transposition into the main line
}) 9... f6 {Now we can see why it was important for Black NOT to have his
knight on f6.} 10. c3 Bd7 {Black realized 3 main opening tasks, he has a very
strong control over the central squares. Black's position is already slightly
better. Most importantly, it's difficult for White to compose any real plan. 
I recommend that you observe the games from the database "2 Instructive games".
There you'll see typical middlegame plans and ideas.} *
