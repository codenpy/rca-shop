{Some players use the following system of playing with White pieces: f4, Nf3,
b3, Bb2, e3, Bb5. It gives White a strong control over e5-square and good
chances for a king-side attack. Here I'll show you the way to neutralize this
plan easily.} 1. f4 c5 {Of course there are many ways to oppose Bird's opening.
1...c5 move is only one of the options.} 2. Nf3 g6 {This is the most precise
order of moves in order to prevent White's plan. Now White can't play b3 since
Black's g7-bishop will start attacking across this diagonal a1-h8. Also it
stops White from development of his light-squared bishop to b5 - there's no
target for the bishop there.} 3. e3 (3. b3 $6 Bg7 {would force White to cover
the long diagonal somehow. After that his b2-bishop will become passive.}) 3...
Bg7 (3... d5 {would give White a chance to develop his f1-bishop to an active
position.} 4. Bb5+) 4. Be2 {Once White developed his bishop to this passive
position, Black is now free to play Nc6 and d5. Black hasn't played these
moves earlier, because in that case White would play Bb5.} Nc6 {Black can
develop his g8-knight to f6 or to e7-squre, while the queen-side knight should
go to c6 for sure. Thus it makes sense to make an obligatory move first.} 5.
O-O {Here black has 4 possible plans: 1) to play d5 getting a standard Dutch
defense position. 2) to play d6 and e5 attacking the white's center. 3) to
play d6 and Nf6. 4) to play d6, e6 and Nge7. All these schemes are good for
black.} d6 6. d3 Nf6 (6... e5 {following with Nge7 is also a good plan for
Black. In this variation Black is going to attack in the center afterwards.}) (
6... e6 {this set up is also good and Gives black a harmonious position.} 7. e4
Nge7 8. Nc3 O-O {Black is going to attack on the queen-side by playing b5-b4.
If white tries to attack on the king-side - black always can block the
position by playing f5.} 9. Be3 Nd4 {! the knight is strong in a center and
also it prevents White from playing d4.}) 7. Nc3 O-O 8. Kh1 Rb8 {After that
Black will play b5-b4 and will develop an attack on the queen-side. The
Black's position is similar to the Dragon variation of Sicilian defense (and
to Closed Sicilian).} *
