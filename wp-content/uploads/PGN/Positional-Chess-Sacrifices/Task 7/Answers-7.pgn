Diagram #} Rxd4 $3 {Out of the blue!! Black understands the momentum and he
sacrificed one rook in order to destroy White's center and explore the light
square weaknesses around White's king.} (14... Rac8 $5) (14... Nb4 $5) (14...
b5 $5) (14... Qa6 $5) 15. exd4 Nxd4 {In most of the cases, the combination of
queen and knight are deadly. White would like to play f3 here in order to
block the long diagonal, but unfortunately, his unprotected queen is under
attack.} 16. Qc1 (16. Qa4 $5 Nf3+ 17. Kh1 e5 $142 $40) 16... Nf3+ 17. Kh1 e5 $1
$36 {A terrific move! Black is using tactics in order to win time and attack a
developed and active piece. Black is wining the battle in the center. Still
the a8-h1 diagonal is very dangerous for White's king.} (17... Nd2+ $6 18. Kg1
Nxc4 {And the game is unclear.}) 18. Be3 Ng4 $5 {This is another very strong
move. Black has fantastic initiative thanks to extremely well placed and
active pieces. White is missing already his light-squared bishop and Black can
create serious problems in the long diagonal. After a long fight, not without
errors, the game ended in a draw.} (18... Nd2+ 19. Kg1 (19. f3 $1 Nxc4 {The
material is equal, but Black has very active pieces, and the initiative.})
19... Nxc4 $15) (18... Rd8 {Activating the rook, the last piece. Black has the
initiative here.}) (18... Ne1+ 19. f3 Nxf3 20. Rxf3 {By giving back the
Exchange, White can stop the attack... The position remains complicated, but
without attack, White can stabilize his position.}) 19. Qc2 Nd2+ 20. Kg1 Nf3+

that, he will continue bringing pieces to the kingside. Black is forced to
capture the rook sooner or later, and White will create a powerful mating net
around Black's king.} (28. Nb4 $5 Ka8 29. a6 $40) (28. a6 $5 Qa5+ $1 {Black
can exchange queens and White's attack isn't so dangerous.}) 28... Bxg4 $6 (
28... Bxh4 $5 $13 {This was the best move because it was necessary for Black
to create counterplay immediately against the f2-e3 pawn chain. Still the
position is equal, but it was difficultt to stop it during the game...} 29. Nb4

Rhb1 $36) 29. Bxg4 Rxg4 30. Reb1 {White has a real threat now on b7 and c6...
This was another reason to keep the light-squared bishop; this bishop was
important to defend the b7-pawn.} axb6 31. axb6 Qh2 {Diagram #} 32. Rh1 $3 {An
amazing sacrifice! White sacrificed the second rook in order to deflect the
queen from the h2-b8 diagonal. White's idea is to play Qa7 and Qa8 in order to
capture the b7-pawn. By deflecting Black's queen, the king stays unprotected.}
(32. Qa7+ $2 Kc8 33. Qa8+ Qb8 $19) 32... Qxh1 33. Qa7+ Kc8 34. Qa8+ Kd7 {Black
has material advantage of two rooks, but his king is unprotected and creates
tactical problems to Black. The second of Black's problems is that their
pieces are not coordinated.} 35. Qxb7+ Ke6 36. Qxc6+ Kf5 37. Qxe8 {White is
threatening Qe5, checkmate, so Black can lose more time.} Rg1 38. Qd7+ $2 {
This could spoil White's initiative, but Black didn't respond in the best way.
White won at the end. Indeed an amazing game full of imagination and some
errors. :-)} (38. b7 $18) 38... Ke4 (38... Kf6 $1 39. Qxd8+ Kg7 $11 40. Nf4 (

very complicated sacrifice. The idea is to stabilize the knight on e5 and open
lines on White's kingside.} (11... gxf5 12. f4 {Black should remove the knight
from e5 but, after that, he will lose the coordination of his pieces.}) 12. g4

without losing anything at all.} (12. O-O-O Qf8 $5 (12... Rf4 $5)) 12... Rxf3

rook because the queen is falling... I hope that you spotted this tactical
blow before playing Rxf5... :)}) 13... Qf8 {Black has very stable pieces on
White's territory. White, still, cannot capture the f3-rook thanks to the fork
on f3, and Black is threatening to activate his bishop on h6. Nunn manages to
win a brilliant game.} 14. Ne4 Bh6 $5 (14... Qf5 $1 {It was even stronger.
