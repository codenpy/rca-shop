game. White has lack of coordination.} Ra3 {Black is not only attacking the
a4-pawn, but creating tactical problems because the g1-rook is unprotected.

open lines. KID is a very dangerous system and a small sidestep by White; it

the checkmate will be inevitable on the light squares. A checkmate that
started from the amazing bishop sacrifice on h3.} (24... Ng5 $2 25. Rf2 $1 {
