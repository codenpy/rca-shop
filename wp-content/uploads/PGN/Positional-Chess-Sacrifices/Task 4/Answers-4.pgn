very active pieces and White has development problems with his queenside
pieces.}) (11... O-O-O $6 12. f3 {Here White is better and the Qe6 is a
tactical target.}) 12. Nc7+ Kd7 13. Nxa8 Qxc4 $1 {Black will recapture the
a8-knight because it is trapped. Meanwhile, he has time to capture another
pawn. Yes, Black's king is in the center, but White doesn't have active pieces
to attack and he cannot open lines. White still should solve the queenside
pieces development. This is the most ambitious continuation from Black's side,
isn't it?} 14. Nc3 Rxa8 {The material is equal here, but black has a better
development and a good activity for his pieces. Black is controlling the
center well, so he manages to fully equalize the game, and now, he is hoping
for more to grab the initiative.} 15. Bg5 e6 16. Re1 Nd5 {This is a good
positional move. Black is exchanging some pieces and doubling his central
pawns (!) but he totally control the open lines, e and c. White cannot
penetrate with his rooks and Black's double central pawns are controlling a
lot of squares; similarly, they are threatening to advance.} 17. Nxd5 Qxd5 18.
Qxd5 exd5 19. Rad1 h6 20. Bc1 d4 $15 {Black has a small but clear advantage
here. The d4-pawn is powerful blocking the c1 dark-squared bishop and the rook.

pieces. After a long game, Anand manages to win it afterwards.} 21. Rd3 Rc8 22.

order to continue the game. But he chose an aggressive one! Black is
sacrificing the Exchange in order to attack the weak a4-pawn, to free the
d5-square for the knight, to dominate on the light squares and to create an
attack against White's king.} (20... Nd7 $5) (20... Qb6 $5) (20... Rb6 $5) (

{Black has the same material. White cannot capture on e7 thanks to a chekcmate
threat on a1. The situation is very uncomfortable for White because his king
is in danger. Black has a clear compensation here and a lot of advantages in
his position.} 25. Kd1 (25. Rxe7 Qa1#) 25... Qd7 26. Ke2 a4 {Now comes another
strategical threat in the position. White's king is unsafe, of course, but
White manages to connect the rooks. However, the a-pawn is very strong and
Black's idea is to create a passed pawn on the queenside. The central
domination can give Black the initiative.} 27. Ra1 Rd8 28. Rhd1 Nd5 {Before
doing anything, Black stabilizes his position by activating and
over-protecting his pieces. This is a good practical lesson to remember from a
strong IM.} 29. Kf2 Ra8 {Black is threatening a3 in order to create the passed
pawn.} 30. Ra3 Qf5 {White's pieces aren't well-coordinated and, for that
reason, Black is attacking on the other side of the board.} 31. Rda1 Nf4 $17 {
Black has a clear avantage because his pieces are extremely active; the
queeside pawns are very strong. The b3-pawn can prove to be very powerful, and
White isn't safe. Black manages to win the game afterwards.} 32. Kg3 (32. Rxa4

this sacrifice, you are betting that your pawns will be stronger in the future.
