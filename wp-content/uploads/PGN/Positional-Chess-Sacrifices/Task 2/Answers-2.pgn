White's king is uncastled. Black is threatening all kinds of discovered
attacks; more specifically, to play Ng3 in order to attack the queen and
capture the unprotected rook on h1. Black is an Exchange down, but you may
like to compare the e4-knight with Rh1; the knight is more active right now.
Please also note that Black is ready to bring the a8-rook to the e-line. In
the light of the above mentioned reasons, Black has the upper hand here.} 18.

to finalize his development and Black creates threats with every move.} 19. Kf3

time in order to show who is in charge. This is a nice strategy; Russians use
to say, if you can repeat the position once, then do it.} (19... g5 $5) (19...

The idea behind this Exchange sacrifice is to have total control over the
center and to dominate on the light squares. In similar Exchange sacrifices,
the rook for the bishop, you are willing to dominate in the bishop's color.
Here, for example, White would like to dominate on the light squares. Please
also note that White can ptotect the Bd5 with the c-pawn, so he can create a
fantastic and very solid base on d5.} (17. Qxd5 Qxd5 18. Rxd5 Bxf3 19. Rxd8+
