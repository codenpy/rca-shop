order to free the c4-square for the bishop. This isn't the best choice
according to the computer; however it's a very annoying move to meet in a real
game situation. Black's problem is that the king on g8 is damaging the
development of the pieces; thus, Black cannot use his own rooks. Similarly,
the bishop, knight and queen can create a powerfull and deadly combination...}

to activate all of his pieces. Yes, the rook can capture the pawn on e5;
however, it will leave the control over the d-line and immediately White will
activate his rook there. White would like to sacrifice a pawn in order to

Black is two pawns down, but his pieces are tremendously active. It's
extremely difficut to face such situations over the board. If your pieces
aren't well coordinated, then it's difficult to find accurate defensive moves.
On the other hand, Black can play very natural attacking moves; it's always
easier to find attacking moves. After a long fight, Black manages to win the
