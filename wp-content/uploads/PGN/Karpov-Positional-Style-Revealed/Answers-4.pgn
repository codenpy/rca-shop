because Black has weaknesses; so, he would like to drive the game into the

limit the mobility of the darck-squared bishop on f6 and, in the future, he
may play the f4 breakthrough.} Ke6 24. Kg2 Kf7 25. f4 $1 {The other breakthrough,

the pawn.} (25. c5 $5 Ne6) 25... exf4 (25... g6 26. f5 gxf5 27. exf5 $16 {

return to the d-line by R3d3. In the appropriate moment, White will play the
e5 break. After a long and fighting game, Karpov managed to win.} g6 29. Bf2

Black didn't manage to control the d5-square, and his pieces are not well
placed. After d5, he cannot recapture because the knight will deliver a fork
to the queen and rook.} (27. Ba1 $5) (27. Rhe1 $5) 27... Bc5 28. Rhe1 {
White's pieces have fantastic positions and they are extremely energetic.
Right now, he's threatening to capture on e6, and then, to give a discovered
attack with the knight. For that reason, Black tried to block the position.} e5

on d5 as well. White's pawn on b5 is a weakness, but it cramps Black's pieces

both weaknesses on a7 and d5.} Rc7 25. Ra3 Qf5 (25... Rxb5 26. Bxb5) 26. Re3 $1

to continue with normal moves. In such cases, you should be extremely careful

himself and resists the temptation to capture a pawn on a7.} (26. Rxa7 Rc2 $132
