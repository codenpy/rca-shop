opposite to each other and we have only one open file, the e-file. Many
students may think that this position is boring and approximately equal, but
this is a wrong evaluation. White is clearly better because he controls the
open e-file, and Black has weaknesses on the kingside and, more specifically,
on the dark squares. They e5-square is extremely important; White is
controlling it right now, but he should increase his influence on it.} (21. f3

before suggesting your move. In any case, on exercises, it's important to
calculate some moves ahead and compose a plan. The idea behind it is to
relocate the knight on e5 via the f3- and d2-squares.} Nf6 23. Nd2 Ne4 24. Bxg7

improve his knight first. In any case, Black cannot do anything with only one
centralized knight. White's idea is to push the queenside pawns, b4 and b5, in
order to create a new weakness there. Karpov managed to win a nice game mainly
thanks to his maneuvering abilities.} Re7 26. b4 Rde8 27. Ne5 Qd8 28. f3 Nxc3

f5-knight is beautifully placed. However, it's important to forsee what pieces
will stay on the board and what are their potentials. Black's bishop on e7 was
a fantastic piece that is used to control the dark squares. After this
exchange, White would like to block the hanging pawns on c5 and d5. The
blockaded squares are d4 and c5.} (16. Qd2 $5) (16. Na4 $5) 16... Qxe7 17. Qd2
{White is highlighting his dominance on the dark squares. Black cannot push
the hanging pawns forward and, for that reason, the d7-bishop will stay in
passivity.} Qh4 18. Ne2 Rfe8 19. b3 Re7 20. Ng3 Qf6 21. f3 $16 {This is another
plan; by putting presure on d5 stops the c5 advancement. White is controlling
the center very well; the e3-bishop has freedom to move because the pawns are
in the opposite color. Black cannot create any real counterplay on the
queenside, and the a7-pawn is permanently weak. For the above-mentioned
reasons, White is clearly better and he managed to win the game afterwards.}
