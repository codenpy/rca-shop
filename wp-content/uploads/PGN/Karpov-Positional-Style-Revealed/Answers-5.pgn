e5 Rac8 16. Rc1 a6 17. b3 Rc7 18. Qd2 Rfc8 {Diagram #} 19. g4 $5 {The position
looks approximately equal, but Karpov foresees that Black cannot do anything
active on the queenside. On the kingside, he can take more space, and the f5
break looks strong. White is fighting for the initiative and, for that reason,
he'd like to open lines on the kingside.} (19. Bf3 $5) (19. Qb2 $5) (19. Ne2 $5
) 19... Bf8 20. Qe3 $1 {
A nice prophylactic move in order to avoid the pin on b4.} Nc6 21. f5 {
A very fighting move that continues White's plan to open lines on the kingside.
} Ba3 22. Rcd1 Nb4 23. Qh6 $1 {Many white pieces are around the enemy king; so,
he's protecting the c3-knight actively. White is threatening f6 and checkmate
on g7.} Qe8 (23... Rxc3 24. f6) 24. Nb1 Bb2 25. Qd2 {
White is highlighting Black's pieces lack of coordination.} Nc2 26. Kh1 {
Another small plan in order to prepare the doubling of the rooks in the f-line.
The position is approximately equal, but Kamsky didn't handle the pressure and
he sacrificed a piece. Later, Karpov won the game.} Qe7 27. Bg1 Nd7 28. Rf3 Qb4
