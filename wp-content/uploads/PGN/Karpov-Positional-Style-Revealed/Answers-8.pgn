active, then you should try to open the position; this is what White did here.
Similarly, Karpov composes a plan that can cramp Black's position. The idea is
to exchange a pair of heavy pieces and then block the queenside pawns.} (23.

{White has a connected passed pawn and a serious advantage.}) 24. Rxd5 Nf6 25.
Re5 $1 {A very nice and strong move that Karpov had calculated before playing
d5. He'd like to drive the game into the endgame because he can stabilize
Black's queenside pawns, create a fantastic outpost for his knight on c4 and
pressure against the b6-pawn. The position is aproximately equal, but White
has a very small but stable initiative.} (25. R5d3 b5 $11 {Black has here
equal chances because his queenside pawns are active and can create
counterplay.}) 25... Qc7 26. Rxe8+ Rxe8 27. a4 $1 $16 {This was the main idea
that cramps Black. Please notice that White stopped the queenside pawns, and
he has his own pawn majority on the kingside.} Rd8 28. Rxd8+ {Black's last
move looked illogical, but there weren't any other good ways to stop Nd4.} Qxd8
29. Ne5 Qd5 30. Nc4 $14 {White achieved his plan. You can see that he has a
small, but stable advantage. Karpov manages to win a brilliant game.} Nd7 31.

20. Ba4 $5 {A very good option that transfers the game into the endgame by
force. It's easy to find what the critical variation is because you're leaving
"unprotected" the e3 by playing a counterattacking move, Ba4.} (20. Rd3 $5 Nd6
21. Nxd6 Qxd6 $14 {White has a small edge here because he's pressing over the
c-line and the c7-pawn. White has active pieces and e6 is a weakness.}) 20...

Bc6 $14 {I hope that you had calculated this variation before deciding to play
Ba4... :-) I'm not claiming that this is easy, but definitely, it's forcing.
It's easier to calculate very forcing variations. White has the advantage here
because Black has weaknesses on the light squares around his king and White
has a light-squared bishop. The e6-pawn is a weakness and this is in White's
favor. White has an active play to transfer his knight to e5, via f3. The
material imbalance favors White because he can find strong squares for his
knight, but Black doesn't have good files for his rooks.} Rhd8 27. Kf2 {
The computer assess this position as approximately equal, but I hope you can
understand and feel that White has the initiative here. The point is that
White can continue improving his position, as you can see with the king. The
e4-knight is doing a fantastic job by protecting the d2-square, a potential
entry point for Black's rooks. Black's main problem is that his rooks cannot
find an object for the attack.} a6 28. Ke2 Ka7 29. Rc2 {Karpov felt that his
position is very good and he is not in a hurry. He overprotects his position
and frees his knight. Now he can continue improving his knight.} h6 30. Nd2 $1
$14 {Another amazing plan. Even the computer starts to realize that Black
cannot improve his position and cannot wait! White's plan is to place the
knight on e5, the bishop on f3 and create problems against Black's king; as
you can see in the sub variation. White has a clear advantage and he manages
to win the game afterwards.} e5 (30... Kb8 31. Nf3 R4d6 32. Ne5 Rd4 33. Bf3 $16
