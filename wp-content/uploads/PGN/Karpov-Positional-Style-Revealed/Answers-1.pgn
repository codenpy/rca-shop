to foresee and understand how the tactical paterns work. Similarly, in chess,
you should not face "ghosts"; and by "ghosts" I mean some unclear variations
or threats from your opponent. In this particular position, he calculates that
he can recapture the bishop on h8 back. However, both players missed a winning

a3 Bf5 16. Re1 Qd7 {Diagram #} 17. Ne5 $5 {In Isolated pawn positions (IQP),
you need to have active pieces and create threats. The d4-pawn is weak by
itself, but it provides extra support on the c5- and e5-squares. Karpov used
the central square in order to activate his knight and create pressure against
the queen and the f7-pawn.} (17. Re3 $5) (17. Ne4 $5) (17. Qd2 $5) (17. Bc2 $6

White could not compensate this with dynamic play.}) 17... Bxe5 18. Rxe5 $1 {
This is a very interesting and strong statistical move. In general, in IQP
positions, you need to control the square in front of the pawn in order to
push it in the appropriate moment. Similarly, he activated the rook.} (18. dxe5

reguires calculations, and Karpov found the best move. He's counterattacking
the knight; thus it seems not good to capture on b3 because the pawns will be
doubled and weak. However, Black doesn't have plenty of options. Please also
notice that continues protecting the d4-pawn by tactical threats, as you can
