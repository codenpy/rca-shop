Bxc5 $5 {This is a very interesting position and both sides has options here.
In general, in the Spanish opening, the queenside knight has a problem; but,
in this particular position, we can say that it is in a fantastic outpost on
c4 and it is threatening to jump on d3. Karpov exchanges his good-looking
e3-bishop for this nice knight, and he planned to attack on the queenside.} (
21. Qd2 $5) (21. Red1 $5) (21. h4 $6 Nd3 $36) 21... Qxc5 22. Qd2 {Suddenly, aft
er this exchange, we can see that Black's plan is not clear, and he cannot use
his bishop pair because the center is blocked. The computer gives a small
advantage to Black, probably because the queenside pawns are more advanced and
he has space. However, if we objectively evaluate this position, we can
understand that White doesn't have any real weaknesses that Black can press.}
Rdb8 23. Reb1 {One of the most difficult things in chess is to place correctly
your rooks... The idea behind this move is to be ready for the fight over the
b-file and, similarly, to push the pawn on b3.} (23. Ba4 $5) 23... Bc8 24. Ne2
Ng7 25. b3 {The game is taken from the under 10 tournament, so the players
were less than 10 years old... It's easier to criticize every move or to
admire the way that Karpov creates statistical plans! He created a stonger
army on the queenside, and we'd like to blow open the position there.} Ba6 26.
cxb4 {Black doesn't have a real plan, so he goes back and forward with his
pieces... On the other hand, Karpov, open the position on the side where he
has almost all of his pieces. Please notice that the bishop on e7 and the
knight on g7 are out of the game.} axb4 27. bxc4 Bxc4 28. Bd3 {A really cool
strategical move! I hope you studied the course about how to exchange pieces.
Asaf Givon created the majority of the videos there, but I added some of them
as well. By his last move, he exchanged one of his bad pieces, the
light-squared bishop; and, in general, he exchanged pieces in order to attack
the weak b4-pawn. The pawn on b4 is weaker because it's more advanced than the
a2, and White can easily bring his knights to the queenside. The e7-bishop and
the g7-knight cannot defend the b4-pawn nor attack a2-pawn either .} Bxd3 29.
Qxd3 Ra3 $4 30. Qxa3 $1 $18 {After this huge error, White gets a winning
material advantage and converts it into a full point.} bxa3 31. Rxb8+ Bf8 32.

the queen into a more active square, f5.} (12. Bc2) 12... Bh5 (12... Bxf5 13.

White's pieces have good activity and coordination.}) 13. Bf4 {White avoids
any exchanges and centralizes his pieces. Again the position is about equal;
however, White's pieces are extremely active and they are controlling almost
all the squares on the e-line.} Nf8 14. Ne5 Ng6 15. Nxg6 $5 {Maybe here Karpov
was in a little hurry to exchange pieces. He had other options, like Be3 or
Bg3, with the idea to push the pawn forward to f4. Black can never capture on
e5 because White can capture with the pawn, creating a backward pawn on d5,
free the d4-square for his knight and threaten the e6 breakthrough at the
appropriate moment.} (15. Bg3 $5 $14 Nxe5 $6 16. dxe5) (15. Be3 Qc7 16. f4 $5)

kingside, but he controls the e-file and, more specifically, the e4- and
e5-squares. The position is slightly better for White, and Black should fight
for the draw.}) 17. Qc2 $14 {White took the very optimistic decision to
capture with the f-pawn. Probably, he was thinking to attack via the f-line,
but it's extremely difficult to put this plan into action. Karpov has a slight
advantage thanks to his active pieces and the control over the e-line. Later
in the game, he won a pawn thanks to his opponent's mistake and, finally, he
managed to win the game.} Bd6 18. Bxd6 Qxd6 19. Nf3 Ne4 20. Ne5 Re6 $2 21. Nxc4

Ng4 {Diagram #} 9. Bg5 {This is a theoretical position, and the main idea of
the Bg5 move is to limit Black's maneuvers on the kingside. Another important
thing to know here is that White doesn't allow Black to exchange the knight
for the bishop.} f6 10. Bc1 Kh8 11. h3 Nh6 {This move might seem extremely
strange; however, the idea is to protect the bishop and then kick away the
knight with h3. Indeed, White lost some tempi, but Black's position is
undermined.} 12. dxe5 fxe5 $6 13. Be3 {Finally, White managed to develop the
bishop in an extremely good square, e3. His pieces look naturally placed in
the center of the board; however, we cannot say the same for Black's knights...

exchanged a potentially dangerous attacker and he stabilized his position.}

breakthrough at the appropriate time, but these options are in his arsenal. He
