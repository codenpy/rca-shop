15. Bxc5 dxc5 {Diagram #} 16. Kb1 $1 {This is a typical King's Indian Defense
position in which, normally, Black attacks on the kingside and White on the
queenside. However, here Karpov made the long castling, and Black's assault
with the pawns on the kingside doesn't have so much sense. On the other hand,
Black cannot use his bishop pair because the center is blocked. I hope you
spot the breakthrough with d6; this is the main asset of White. However,
before performing his main plan, d6, Karpov played some prophylactic moves.} (
16. Rd1 $5) (16. h4 $5) (16. Nb5 $5) 16... a4 17. Rd1 Bd7 {It's important to
react to your opponent's plans. It's clear that Black would like to sacrifice
the pawns, a la Benko style, on the queenside. For that reason, he prepares
himself by putting his king in a safer square.} 18. Ka1 $5 {
Of course, White has other good possible alternatives.} (18. Nb5 $5) (18. a3 $5
) 18... a3 19. b3 Rf6 20. Nc1 {This is a little difficult move to understand,
but his aim is to regroup the pieces and put the knight on the d3-square. From
d3, the knight will attack both c5 and e5. Unfortunately, White cannot make
the breakthrough on e6 right now, but he may prepare it by doubling the rooks
on the d-line.} b5 21. Nxb5 Bxb5 22. cxb5 Rb6 23. Ne2 {In a real game, you
cannot prevent or control everything. For that reason, you should have a plan
and adjust it according to your opponent's reactions. He returned the knight
to e2 in order to overprotect his extra pawn.} Qb8 24. Nc3 $16 {
White is a clear pawn up with technically a winning position.} Qa7 25. Qc4 Rd6

A really strong and difficult move to spot if you don't play 1.d4. The idea is
to prevent Nh5; I mean Black was threatening to play g5, Bg3 and Nh5.Similarly,
the knight is aiming at the c4-square. Please also note that the f-pawn is not
free and it might advance to f4. Thus, Karpov played a prophylactic move that
promotes his strategical plan.} g5 15. Bg3 Re8 {Diagram #} 16. Re1 {Another 
prophylactic move. He's overprotecting his e-pawn, freeing the f1-square for 
the bishop, and keeping his pieces harmonically placed.} Rb8 17. a5 $1 {Another 
prophylactic move! It's important to prevent your opponent plans, if you can. 
The position is blocked, so White cannot prepare any immediate attack on the 
week pawn or square; thus, it's important to prevent the opponent's activity.} 
Bf5 (17... b5 18. axb6 Rxb6 19. Bxe5 Qxe5 (19... dxe5 20. Nc4 $16) 20. Nc4 $18) 
18.e4 {Once again, he tried to disorganize Black's pieces and win more space.
Please notice that this move is possible because he can overprotect his
e4-pawn many times. Such moves are not possible if you didn't perform
prophylactic moves earlier.} Bg6 19. Ra4 $16 {The position is complete, but
White has the upper hand thanks to his space advantage and more active pieces.
Karpov overprotects everything in his position and stops Black's main
breakthrough on b5. After a fighting game, he manages to win.} Nfd7 20. Qc2
