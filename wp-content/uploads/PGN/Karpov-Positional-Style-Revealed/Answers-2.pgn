Analyzing the position, we can see that the material is equal. However, this
is not the only aspect in order to judge the position. Bg7 is a bad piece
because it's locked behind its own e5 pawn. Black has concentrated his pieces
on the kingside and he attacks White's king. On the other side of the board,
we can see that White has already two pieces, Be3 and Nc4. By offering the
queen's exchange, he would like to attack the queenside pawns. Please notice
that Black cannot avoid the queen's exchange because the e5-pawn is hanging.}

structure; it's called Carlsbad structure. The main idea is to push the pawn
on b5 and exchange on c6 in order to create a backward pawn. Usually, Black
should create counterplay in the kingside, but he doesn't activate it in this
particular position.} (17. h3 $5) (17. Ne1 $5) (17. Nd2 $5) (17. Qb3 $5) (17.
Qd2 $5) 17... axb5 18. axb5 {White had plenty of interesting moves, like to
maneuver the knight in a better place or to step away the queen from the
c-line. However, Karpov used the most direct way and performed his statistical
plan immediately because his opponent didn't have counterplay. Please also
notice that Black cannot really take on b5 because he will create more
weaknesses in his pawn structure.} c5 19. dxc5 Qxc3 20. Rxc3 Rxc5 21. Rxc5 Nxc5
22. Nd4 $16 {After all of these exchanges, we can see that the d5-pawn is
extremely bad because it's isolated. Similarly, this pawn is in the same color
as the bishop, and this is very bad news for Black: his bishop's mobility is
reduced by this pawn. White controls the open a-line. Another possible target
is b7. Karpov has a clear advantage here and he manages to win the game
afterwards.} Ne6 23. f3 Nxd4 24. exd4 Bc2 25. Kf2 Bb3 26. Ra7 Re7 27. Ra3 Bc2
