{White bishop is better than its counterpart that defines White`s advantage.
It`s also obvious that White`s only chances of beaking through can only be
connected with his play on the kingside. But first White is making a very
important preparation move.} 31. a4 {don`t hurry! White is getting rid of the
potential weakness on a2.} Ke7 32. Bd5 Rc7 33. Rh4 h6 {[%csl Gh6] A new
