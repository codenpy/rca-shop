rooks. Black is temporarily a piece down, but he has to move; so, he can
capture one of White's light pieces, the knight or the bishop. During the game,
Black calculated and chose correctly to capture the knight in order to
penetrate in the second rank.} (26... Rxb6 $5 27. Rf3 a3 $5 $36 (27... Rbd6 $5

is under a huge pressure.}) 27... Re3 $1 {Black correctly chooses to keep the
rooks on the board because they could be possibly more active to penetrate in
the second rank. White doesn't have any good discovery with the d4-rook
because the b6-bishop is under attack.} (27... Rxb6 $2 28. Rxd3) 28. Ba7 Rxb2

the rooks on the best position.} 30. Rc1 Ke8 $1 {Prophylaxis can save some
time. Of course, Black has other moves available; however, he correctly and
totally secured his king. Similarly, he frees his bishop from e7, which was
pined.} (30... Rxg2+ $5) 31. Rcd1 Rxg2+ 32. Kf1 Rxh2 33. Bg1 Rh4 {White
manages to defend in the second rank; however, the killing blow comes from
another side. Black is using the activity of his pieces by creating deadly
threats. Apart from that, Black has a huge material advantage.} 0-1

important to keep it in mind because this tactic trick may occur in your games.
