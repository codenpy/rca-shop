{For a rook, especially in the endings, being able of controlling the open and
half-open files is crucial. It makes the rook very active which might become a
decisive factor especially when there's still a lot of pawns on the board and
relatively few passed pawns.} 1. Rd2 {The difference between the rooks is
really visable. White rook has to defend the isolated d-pawn, whereas black
one not only keeps and eye on white's queenside, but also supports the king's
manoeuver.} Ke7 2. Ke3 Kf6 3. f4 Kf5 4. Kf3 h5 5. b3 (5. h3 g5 6. g4+ hxg4+ 7.

another weakness. White's overloaded rook won't be able to keep all of the
pawns alive.} 6. Rd3 $22 (6. Re2 a4 7. Re7 Kf6 8. Rd7 axb3 9. Rxd6+ Ke7 $19)

{In rook endings, sacrificing a pawn in order to activate a rook is a resource
that allows to hold the game very often. It's always better than waiting for
