18.e5 $5 {This is a very brave and risky decision. White has very
good control over the center and the bishop pair. No one forced
him to attack immediately. After this move, White is forced to
calculate a lot of variations. Can you calculate the next two
forcing moves for both sides and evaluate the position at the
end?} (18.a3 $1 {This is a safe move. White should make it and
prepare the e5 advance in the future.}) 18...dxe5 19.Bxe5 Ng6 $2 {This
is very provocative. Black would like to isolate the e5-pawn
and play for the win. First, however, he should worry about White's
threats and, only afterwards, should he attack. The b7-pawn is
hanging. After this move, knight to g6, White has an awesome
tactical trick, as you can see in the sub-variation.} (19...c6 $1 {Black
does not face any problems here. The position is about equal.
There are pros and cons to each player's position.}) 20.Be4 $2 {This
is a bad move, as White had two candidate moves. The first was
to capture on b7 and the second was to protect the a-pawn with
the move a3.} (20.Bxb7 Rxa2 21.Qxg6 $3 {This is a fantastic move!} fxg6 22.Rxf8+

is a fat, sweet pawn. Black captures it and can hope to win the

that one pawn is enough to win in the endgame. Black wins the

move? It seems that Black can capture en passant and then take
on c3. Is this possible?} cxb3 18.Bxb3 {The choice of b4 is a
good move because White is following the right plan. He would
like to open the queenside in order to attack there. In the actual
game, White doesn't find a justification for the b4 move but
merely follows his intuition and, indeed, is correct. Black should
not capture the c3-pawn immediately.} bxa4 19.Rxa4 Qxc3 $4 20.Rb1 $6 (20.Bc4 $3

16...Kh8 $2 {Black would like to play attacking chess. His idea
is to play f5 and open the position. What do you think: is this
good or bad strategy?} (16...Nf6 $1 {Black plays a very provocative
move - king h8. The best move was knight to f6, in order to fight
against bishop d5. If our opponent has a very strong piece, we
should exchange it.}) 17.Ng5 {This is a forcing move. As we learned
from the theoretical part, it is necessary to make forcing moves.} h6 (17...Kg8

22. Nc4 $2 {White starts an attacking plan. He would like to place the knight
on a5 and create strong threats against the enemy king. At the same time,
White is overprotecting the vital e3 square. Right now, Black cannot jump to
e3 with the knight. Is this move tactically correct for White?} (22. O-O $1 {
The correct move was to castle short. White should finish his development at
any cost.}) 22... Bb4+ $1 {The hunting period starts! All of Black pieces will
hunt the White monarch. Similarly, the d-pawn is a very powerful direct force
for Black.} 23. Kf2 d3 {
Black attacks the queen and is opening more lines for his pieces.} 24. Qd1 Bc5+
25. Kf1 d2 {This pawn is almost a new queen. White cannot protect himself from
the deadly check on d3.} 26. Nfxd2 Qd3+ (26... Qd3+ 27. Ke1 Bxg2 28. Rf1 Bxf1

1.e4 Nf6 2.Nc3 d5 3.e5 d4 4.Nce2 Ne4 5.c3 {We start this game
at the very beginning but it is possible to face this situation
in your real games. What do you think now: what is the best move
for Black?} Nc5 $2 {Black threatens checkmate on d3 but it is White's
turn. So White sees this threat and happily captures a pawn.} (5...dxc3 $1

18...a5 $2 {Black starts the pawn storm on the queenside. Is this
the best move: what do you think?} (18...e6 $8 {Black should challenge
White's center and then think of something else.}) 19.e6 $1 {This
is a fantastic and very powerful move. White has better control
of the center and uses it in order to open lines and attack the
disorganized Black pieces. Control the center and you control
the game.} fxe6 20.dxe6 Nxe6 21.Neg5 {The basic problem for Black
is the pinned knight on d7. White wins the game very soon afterwards.}
