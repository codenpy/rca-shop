21...Nxe4 $1 {Black to play. By going back and forward with his
pieces, White hasn't played good moves in the middlegame. Now
Black has the opportunity, with some forcing moves, to destroy
his position. This move looks like a mistake because Black's
queen cannot defend the bishop on e7 and the knight on e4. Black
has a specific tactical idea in mind.} 22.Bxe7 Ned2 $1 {This is
a very strong counter-blow and forcing move. Black would like
to destroy the cover for White's king.} 23.Bxb3 (23.Bxd6 {White
cannot keep the material because he will lose, as we can see
in the following variation.} Bxf3 24.gxf3 Nxf3+ 25.Kf1 Nbd2+ 26.Ke2 Qe4#)
23...Nxf3+ $1 {Black is playing very accurately and in a forcing
manner. Check is the most forcing move. It is more important
to destroy White's pawn structure on the kingside than to recapture
the bishop on b3.} 24.gxf3 Bxf3 25.Bxd6 (25.Qd2 {White cannot
try to save his queen because Black can deliver checkmate, as
we can see in the following variation:} Qd7 $1 26.Bh4 Qh3 27.Bg3 Qg2# {The
light squares around the White king are very week.}) 25...Bxd1 26.Bxd1

close to a winning position. Black continues to play forcing
chess.} 28.Bg3 Qxd4 $6 {Here, Black loses control of the game.
Now White manages to coordinate his pieces and, consequently,
gets some counter-play.} (28...Re8 $1 {This is the best move because
the queen can win White's three minor pieces which are not well
coordinated.} 29.Rxe8+ Qxe8) 29.Bf3 Qd2 30.Rd1 Qxd1+ 31.Bxd1 Ra1 32.Kg2

30.Nxe6 $2 {White to play. He tries to play forcing chess and complicate
the position. White's position is worse, so he cannot play tactical
moves and change the situation. As Fischer used to say, tactics
flow from a superior position. The best move for White is to
capture the strong knight on d5 and then try to equalize the
game.} (30.Bxd5 $5 exd5 $15) 30...Bxe6 31.Bxd5 e3 $3 {This is a very
strong and forcing reply White has missed. Do you remember Fischer's
quote: 'It is very natural to see a good tactical blow from Black
because they have a better position"? By the way, this is the
only strong move that gives Black a better position. If a player
misses such moves, his advantage will slip away. Ex-World Champion
Anand is a very strong player and rarely misses such opportunities.} 32.Bxe3

better.}) 25.f5 $1 {Again, White is forcing the issue. He wins

10... h6 $1 {Black starts playing forcing chess. First of all, he would like
to repulse the dark-squared bishop on g5.} 11. dxe5 Nxe5 12. Nxe5 hxg5 {
This is an important decision because Black captures the strong bishop on g5.
The knight on e5 is attacked and has no good squares for the retreat. After
some forcing moves, the h-file will be open and it will be easier for Black to
use it to attack.} 13. Ng4 Nxg4 14. hxg4 Be6 {After the forcing moves, Black
has the bishop pair. The g4-pawn is weak and Black is attacking it with the
bishop. Black cannot capture it right now but his bishop is forcing the White
queen on to the defensive.} 15. Ne4 Qe7 16. Qf3 Be5 $1 {Black is preparing the
attack on the kingside. His plan is very simple - to play king g7, rook h4 and
a-rook to h8. White has no forcing moves or any real counter-play.} 17. Nd2 b5
$2 (17... d5 $1 {If Black wants to control the c4 square, he should play d5.
Black doesn't use the anti-blunder technique, therefore he drops the c6-pawn.
White should capture on c6 and complicate the game but doesn't do so.}) 18. a3

17.d5 $5 {This is a very interesting attacking move. The idea behind
it is to use brute force to destroy the Black king's pawn cover.
Objectively, this is not the best move but White has a clear
plan, to attack on the kingside, plus he is playing forcing moves.
This strategy combination proves deadly in this game.} (17.g4 $5 {This

another forcing move. White opens the position and none of Black's
heavy pieces can help. It is well known among chess players that

26. Qg3 $2 {First things first, we should not go backwards with our pieces.
Second. we should play with a plan. Playing with a plan means that we should
create active pieces and then strike. The move queen to g3 doesn't help White
to create active pieces. Here, White should play the forcing move f5, which
could keep him out of trouble. Last, but not least, White should ask: "What is
the threat from Black?" If we take a close look at Black's pieces, then we can
understand that they are active and ready to strike in the center. Black would
first like to play e5 and then d5. White has a tactical problem. This
particular problem has a name - bishop b2 - as it is unprotected. Of course,
it is very difficult to spot the bishop on b2 but it is easy to play forcing
moves like f5. The conclusion is this: always try to play attacking and
forcing moves.} (26. f5 $5 {Playing forcefully...}) (26. Ba1 $5 {Profilaxis})
