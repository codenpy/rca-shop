White is forced to move his queen again.} 7.Qf3 (7.Qg3 {Black's
queen is powerful, so White should exchange queens. White's queen
wrongly goes to f3, which is a good developing square for the
knight.}) 7...Nc6 8.d3 Qe5+ 9.Qe3 Bc5 $1 $17 {Black plays very well,

about. Instead, White should focus on other developing moves.} Nf6 6.Nf3

understand why White captures on c5, helping Black to develop
his bishop. A much better move is to castle short. Perhaps White
is afraid the c4 advance, but Black's pawn majority is not dangerous
on the queenside. The move c4 will free White's hands, so White
can push his center pawn on e4 after some moves with piece preparation.}
