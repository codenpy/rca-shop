1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 {With this move order White tries to avoid the main
line of the Grunfeld defense with normal move d4. Here White tries to play
without d4.} d5 {Black must play now 3...d5 if he wants to play the Grunfeld
defense. If now Black for example plays 3...Bg7 than White can play 4.e4 and
Black can not play Grunfeld any more.} (3... Bg7 4. e4 $5 {White does not
allow Grundfeld defense. Now Black must play  kind of Indian defense or
something similar.}) 4. cxd5 Nxd5 5. Qa4+ {Instead of 5.d4 which brings this
game to the normal Grunfeld position, here White wants to discoordinate
Black's pieces. Now Black can not play a normal Grunfeld plan and he needs to
be very careful not to get into a bad position. Nevertheless with so early
developing of the Queen, White somehow brings his Queen to the possible attack
from the Black's light pieces.} (5. d4 Nxc3 6. bxc3 Bg7 {Normal Grundfeld
position.}) 5... Bd7 6. Qb3 Nb6 7. d4 Bg7 8. Bf4 Be6 9. Qc2 {After 9 moves
White develops all the queenside but the kingside is still undeveloped. Also
his Queen was under attack and White needs to play one more time with his
Queen. Black for now moves his Knight from d5 to b6 in order to defend his b7
pawn and light-squared Bishop gets on e6 square with a tempo on White's Queen.
Position is about equal.} Nc6 {Nice move. Black now prevents White from
playing e4. Now White will need to play e3 and with that move he will not have
better center.} 10. Rd1 O-O 11. e3 Nb4 12. Qb1 {White's Queen now plays third
time in the opening. Black develops all his pieces and completely equalizes
the game.} Bf5 $5 {Black tries now to force White to play e4 in order to
attack his exposed pawns in the center later on.} (12... N6d5 13. Be5 Nxc3 14.
bxc3 Nd5 15. Qc2 c5 $13) 13. e4 Bg4 14. d5 f5 $6 {Black now makes a small
inaccuracy in this position. Much stronger was 14...Bf3 when Black takes over
the initiative.} (14... Bxf3 $1 15. gxf3 e6 16. dxe6 Qf6 17. exf7+ Qxf7 $17)
15. Be2 fxe4 16. Qxe4 Nc2+ 17. Qxc2 Rxf4 {Black now has an equal position.
White will consolidate after 0-0 and the game is even.} 18. O-O Qd7 19. Ne1 {
White now does not want to play any aggressive moves. With this move he wants
to exchange few pieces and draw the game.} Raf8 20. Bxg4 Qxg4 21. Nd3 Rc4 22.
Qb3 a5 23. Qa3 a4 24. h3 Qd7 25. Nc5 Qd6 26. N3e4 Qe5 27. Nd2 Rc2 {White now
has a bad pawn on d5 and Black has his weak pawn on e7. Position is equal.
With next few moves both players do not want to take any risks and the game
ended as a draw very quickly.} 28. Nxa4 Nxa4 29. Qxa4 Qxb2 30. Ne4 Qxa2 31. Qd7
Qa8 32. Qe6+ Kh8 33. Rc1 Rxc1 34. Rxc1 Qa5 35. Rb1 b6 {With a draw.} 1/2-1/2

play the Grunfeld defense in somewhat other way. First he does not want to
allow Black to exchange the Knight on f6 via d5 on c3 and also he will not
have a bad pawn on c3 after this Knight's exchange. Also White now make the
pressure on d5 pawn and black is almost forced to take the pawn on c4.
Nevertheless White plays with his Queen early in the game and Black will have
an extra option of chasing this white Queen. This position is very reach and
has a lot of tactical options.} dxc4 (5... c6 $5 6. e3 O-O 7. Bd2 e6 8. Bd3
Nbd7 9. O-O b6 {With this setup Black also has a very playable position but
this position is more like in the Queen's gambit than like the Grunfeld
defense and that's why Black players who want to play the Grunfeld do not want
to enter it. Nevertheless this position is also very good for Black.}) 6. Qxc4
O-O 7. e4 a6 $5 {Very smart move. Black want to play b5 and Bb7 with next move
c5. White queen is exposed on c4 and black will have time for develop his
pieces and chasing the Queen.} 8. Be2 b5 9. Qb3 c5 {This is temporarily pawn
