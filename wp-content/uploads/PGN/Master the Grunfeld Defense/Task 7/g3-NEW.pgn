then bring the Knight on e5 via c4.} 10. Qe1 Nac4 11. Nc3 e6 {The center of
White is pretty advanced but his pieces cannot help to defend those advanced
positions. Black is undermining center with his last move, you should remember
and implement in your practical game this idea: If the center of your opponent
is very advanced but he cannot yet sufficiently support it - you need to
undermine it by attacking with your pawns.} 12. b3 Ne5 13. Nxe5 Bxe5 14. Bh6
