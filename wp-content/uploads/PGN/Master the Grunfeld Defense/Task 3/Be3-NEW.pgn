the structure of the kingside. At the end of the day, this position is better

Both: The Knight and the Bishop of Black are located on very good positions.
The weakness of the "f" pawns gets to be more and more visible.} Rf6 22. Rc4 {
Nice move, White tries to engage his Rook more actively in the game.} Raf8 (

not that dangerous for White.} 24. Rc1 Rd8 25. Bg2 e6 (25... Rfd6 26. Rc6 Kf7 {

pair. At the end of the day, the draw is a fair result of the game.} 1/2-1/2

development. But for now, there are no real threats for Black in this position.
