Black is trying to undermine White's center right away.} 8. Ne2 {This is better
than Nf3, because here, if Black puts his Bishop on g4, White will be able to
block the pin by moving the "f" pawn one square further.} (8. Nf3 O-O 9. O-O

shall play 8. Ne2.}) 8... O-O 9. O-O Nc6 10. Be3 Bg4 {This is not the best
move, because it is clear that White will meet it with 11. f3. Na5 right away
was better for Black.} 11. f3 Na5 12. Bxf7+ (12. Bd3 {This move was also
worthy consideration, White's position is substantially better. He can try to
exchange the only powerful piece of Black (the Bishop on g7) putting the Queen
on d2 and then Bh6.}) 12... Rxf7 13. fxg4 Rxf1+ 14. Kxf1 cxd4 15. cxd4 {
White is a pawn up, but his structure is not that good, if Black will be able
to grasp the initiative then it might be a problem for White.} e5 16. d5 {
Now things are even better for White, he has a protected passed pawn. So the
good strategy for White now will be to try to exchange all the pieces and go
to the end game, where the passing pawn would be even more substantial
advantage.} Nc4 17. Qd3 b5 18. g5 {Not the best move, personally, I do not see
the reason for this move. This pawn on g5 might become the target for the
attack of Black.} (18. Kg1 Bf8 19. h3 Qa5 20. Bf2 {This was better for White.})
18... Bf8 19. Ng1 Nxe3+ {This is an interesting move, because that Knight on
c4, in my opinion, is a better piece than the Bishop on e3. From the practical
perspective the exchange is surely justified, but I am sure it is not the best
move objectively. Simple Qc7 would be better.} 20. Qxe3 Qb6 21. Qc3 b4 22. Qc4
Bd6 23. Ke2 a5 24. Nh3 $2 {Now Black equalized the position. He has advanced
the pawns on the queenside, improved the position of his Bishop, activated the
Queen. And White should have put the Knight on f3, also, it is time to think
about the Rook on a1.} (24. Nf3 a4 25. Rb1 Kg7 26. h3 Ra7 27. Qc6 Qd8 28. Qb5
Qc7 29. Qd3 {This was much better for White.}) 24... a4 25. Nf2 Qd8 {The wrong
