Rb1 {This is a very aggressive move from White. The idea is to bring the Rook
immediately on half-opened b-file and make the pressure on b7 pawn. In this
variation in order to get the initiative White often sacrifices one, sometimes
even two pawns (a2 and c3 pawns).} O-O 9. Be2 cxd4 {Other moves for Black are
Nc6 or even b6.} (9... Nc6 10. d5 Ne5 (10... Bxc3+ 11. Bd2 Bxd2+ 12. Qxd2 $36 {
Here after Black moves the Knight, White has a huge initiative with a very
easy plan. h4 - h5 and the Black King is in a great danger.}) 11. Nxe5 Bxe5 12.
Qd2 e6 13. f4 Bg7 (13... Bc7 {This move is designed against the White's move
c4. Now if White wants to play c4 he must move the King first and Black gets
some time for play in the center.} 14. O-O (14. c4 $4 Ba5 $19) 14... exd5 15.
exd5 Ba5 $13 {Now Black plays all the moves that he wants but this Bishop is
somehow misplaced on a5, because originally this Bishop needs to be on g7 and
protect the Black King. After 16.f5 White has a very nice initiative and a
good attack on the Black' King. Position is still close to equal but White has
the initiative on the kingside.}) 14. c4 Re8 15. e5 $14 {White has some
advantage in space and in those central pawns.}) (9... b6 {This is another
alternative. Here Black wants to develop all of his pieces somehow in more
positional style. In my view this is not the best idea. After White develops
all pieces will be better because of more space and somehow passive Black
pieces.} 10. O-O Bb7 11. Qd3 e6 12. Bg5 Qc7 13. Qe3 $14) 10. cxd4 Qa5+ {
Black's idea here is to take advantage of the thing that White's King is still
in the center and with this move he wants to take the pawn on a2 or if White
wants to exchange the Queens than Black will have a pawn majority on the
queenside.} 11. Bd2 (11. Qd2 Qxd2+ 12. Bxd2 b6 13. O-O Bb7 14. d5 Ba6 $11 {
Position is equal.}) 11... Qxa2 12. O-O Bg4 {Black has an idea to push the "a"
pawn. With Bg4 Black sacrifices sometimes b7 pawn in order to push "a" pawn.
Also with this move Black causes the pressure against d4 pawn and White needs
to be careful.} 13. Bg5 Qe6 (13... h6 $5 {Nice alternative to 13...Qe6. White
can't take on e7 because of Re8 and Black will take very important pawn of
White on e4.} 14. Bh4 (14. Bxe7 Re8 15. Rxb7 Nd7 16. Bc5 Rxe4 $15 {Black is a
little bit better.}) 14... a5 $5 $13 {Position is very double-edged but Black
is not worse.}) 14. d5 Qxe4 $11 {White sacrifices a pawn in order to simplify
the position. Now position is equal but Black has at this moment two extra
pawns and a very comfortable position.} 15. Rxb7 Be6 $6 {Better was Nd7.} 16.

Rb1 O-O 9. Be2 Nc6 $5 {Super GM Fabi uses this move few times. This is a side
move or alternative to the main move 9...Qa5. The idea is to develop as
quickly as possible in order to attack the White's pawn center. Drawback is in
the fact that this allows a quick expansion of White pawns in the center.
White will have a chance to sacrifice the pawn on c3 for the initiative.
Position is very double-edged} 10. d5 Ne5 (10... Bxc3+ $6 11. Bd2 Bxd2+ 12.

strong idea to push h4-h5 and attack the Black's King, which is without any
defense.}) 11. Nxe5 Bxe5 12. Qd2 e6 13. f4 Bc7 $5 {The idea is not allow White
to push c4 and connect his pawn center because of Ba5. Drawback is that now
the Black King is in danger because of the fact the Bishop is on c7 and not on
g7, where he would be protecting the Black monarch.} (13... Bg7 14. c4 Re8 15.

playable. White has a nice d-pawn but Black managed to block White's

variation in order to get the initiative White often sacrifices one, sometimes
even two pawns (a2 and c3 pawns).} O-O 9. Be2 cxd4 10. cxd4 Qa5+ {Black's idea
here is to take the advantage of the fact that White's King is still in the
center and with this move he wants to take the pawn on a2, or if White wants
to exchange the Queens than Black will have pawns' majority on the queenside.}
11. Bd2 {Main move. Alternative is 11.Qd2 while after 11...Qd2 12.Bd2 position
is equal.} (11. Qd2 {White doesn't allow Black to take the pawn on a2, but
with this move somehow do not play with the idea of sacrificing the pawn in
order to get the initiative. After this move position is completely equal.}
Qxd2+ 12. Bxd2) 11... Qxa2 12. O-O Bg4 {This is the main and in my view the
best move in the position. Black wants to take the pawn on d4 for the moment;
White doesn't have enough time to take the pawn on b7.} (12... b6 {In this
position this is the main alternative to Bg4. Idea is to develop the
light-squared Bishop to b7 and protect the b pawn by moving it to b6. Next,
Black wants to put the pressure on e4 pawn and after this playing Nc6 and push
on the d4 square. The drawback is that after this Queen will be wrongly placed
on the queenside and potentially can be in a great danger. In this line White
can easily make the draw by repetition, attacking exposed Black's Queen.} 13.

draw.}) 16... Rc8 17. Qd1 Qc2 18. Qe2 Nc6 19. Bd3 Qa2 20. Bc4 $14 {White has a
small advantage because Black's Queen is in the danger and also White have a
very nice initiative for the sacrificed pawn.}) 13. Bg5 {With this move White
attacks the pawn on e7, but the main reason for playing it is in the fact that
he needs to defend the d4 pawn.} (13. Be3 $5 {Alternative to Bg5. White makes
extra protection for his d4 pawn but now this Bishop does not attack the e7
pawn.} Nc6 14. d5 Na5 15. Bg5 Qa3 16. Bd2 $13 {Position is very unclear. Black
has his extra pawn, but his pieces: the Knight and the Queen are very exposed
and White has a full compensation.}) 13... h6 14. Bh4 (14. Bxe7 $6 {This is
not the good move. White takes on e7 but stays without his e4 pawn and his
center collapses. Black has after this an equal play and White does not have
any initiative.} Re8 15. Rxb7 Nc6 16. Bc5 Rxe4 $11) 14... a5 {This is the main
Black's idea. This passed pawn give him very active play.} 15. Rxb7 g5 16. Bg3

wants to develop his last piece - Knight on b8 and then move the "a" pawn.} 17.
d5 Bxf3 18. Bxf3 Nd4 19. Rxe7 a4 $13 {Now White has an extra pawn but Black
gets the initiative. Black stays with the perfect pieces: his Queen, a nice
Bishop on g7 and a great Knight on d4. All together with the Rook on a8 all
Black pieces are supporting advancing of the a pawn.}) 17. h4 Nc6 18. hxg5 hxg5

position for Black. All his pieces play very well and they control all vital
squares. Position is about equal but Black has the initiative.} 21. d6 e5 22.

perfectly played by both sides.} 23. Bg4 Qc6 24. Rb1 Qxe4 25. Re1 Qd5 26. Bf5
Rad8 27. Be4 {White gets his Bishop on the dominant square in the center and
now he wants to attack the Black's King.} Qe6 28. Qh5 f5 {Black can not play
without this move. Now his King is a little bit exposed.} 29. Bd3 $6 (29. Rb6

to play f4 and build a nice looking center. Black is slightly worse in both
continuations.} e6 13. f4 Bc7 $5 {Very brave. Black does not allow White to
take on d5 with the "c" pawn because of Ba5. After this move White will not

worse than his alternatives. Later Black players find better moves like 12...
Nc6 or even 12...Bg4. Black wants to bring this Knight to b6 in order to
prevent White from taking the b7 pawn after Black will develop the
light-squared Bishop. Nevertheless this is not the best way to play. Now this
Knight will be not on the best square on b6. Natural square for this Knight is
c6 from which this Knight attacks White's central pawn on d4. After this move
White is better.} 13. Bb4 (13. Ra1 {[%emt 0:00:06]}) 13... Nb6 14. Ne5 {Now it
is clear that Black's plan to bring the Knight to b6 is not the best idea.
This White Knight originally plays a defensive role and defends d4 pawn and
here he plays very active because the Black Knight is on the wrong square.} (
