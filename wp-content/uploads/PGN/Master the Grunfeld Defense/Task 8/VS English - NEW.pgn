1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. cxd5 Nxd5 5. Bd2 $5 {This is a rare line in
the Grunfeld defense. With 6.Bd2 White potentially wants to take on c3 with
his Bishop.} Nb6 6. Bf4 Bg7 7. e3 O-O 8. Nf3 c5 $1 {One year later Ipatov
played this line against Kalinin and he played here 8...Nc6. Black temporarily
sacrificed a pawn for the active play.} 9. dxc5 N6d7 10. Bc4 Nxc5 11. Be5 Be6 {
A very nice play by Black and very inacurate play by White. Black manages to
take the pawn on c5 and with exchange of the Bishops position is completely
equal.} 12. Bxe6 Nd3+ 13. Ke2 Nxe5 14. Qxd8 Rxd8 15. Nxe5 Bxe5 16. Bb3 {Black
equalizes the position easily. Position is completely equal. Black has a Rook
on the open file and White has a little bit more active King.} Bxc3 $5 {his
move has a deep strategic idea. Black wants to destroy White's pawn structure
on the queenside and then make the pressure against it. Nevertheless White
gets the Bishop against the Black Knight with pawns on both sides and the
position is about equal.} 17. bxc3 Nd7 18. Rhd1 Nc5 19. f3 e6 20. Rxd8+ Rxd8
21. Rd1 Rc8 $1 {This is a strong move. Black can not exchange both Rooks. One
Rook needs to stay on the board because without it Black will not be able to
cause any pressure against c pawn.} (21... Rxd1 $6 22. Bxd1 Kf8 23. Bb3 Ke7 24.

want to show Black what is his idea in the opening. White can play classical
fianchetto variation or try to take the advantage over d4 move and try to make
some English type of the position.} g6 5. Bg2 c6 $6 {This is a very rare move
and I think it is a novelty in this game. In my view more natural move is 5...

clearly a waste of a tempo.} (5... Nxc3 6. bxc3 Bg7 7. Nf3 O-O 8. O-O {With

without d4.}) (5... Nb6 6. Nf3 Bg7 7. O-O O-O 8. d4 Nc6 $13 {With the
classical Grunfeld position.}) 6. d4 $1 {Now Black has one tempo less than in

1. c4 g6 2. Nf3 Bg7 3. d4 Nf6 4. Nc3 d5 5. cxd5 Nxd5 6. Bd2 $5 {This is rare
line in the Grunfeld defence. With 6.Bd2 White potentially wants to take on c3
with his Bishop.} Nb6 {The most natural move. Black does not want to take on
c3 and move his Knight to b6.} (6... Nxc3 7. Bxc3 O-O 8. e4 $14 {White is
better. His Bishop is the most active diagonal a1-h8 and compare with the main
line where White takes with pawn on c3 White has a better development and more
active play.}) 7. Bf4 O-O 8. e3 $11 {White tries to build a very nice and
solid position but nothing more. He plays two times in the opening with the
dark-squared Bishop and now with e3 White does not occupy center and Black is
completely fine. White has lost the opening advantage.} Nc6 9. h3 {Idea of the
last move is not allow Black's light-squared Bishop to develop on g4 or, maybe,
even to exchange.} Be6 {This is move that has been played before. It looks
like Black wants to develop his last piece but in my view this gives White a
little bit better position.} (9... e5 $5 {This is a very interesting move.
After this Black is just fine and the position is equal.} 10. dxe5 Qe7 11. Be2
Nxe5 12. O-O Rd8 $11 {With the equal chances for both sides.}) 10. Be2 Nd5 {
Here ends Black's idea related with move 9...Be6. Black wants to take
advantage over the diagonale a8-h1 with exchange of Knights and then bringing
the light-squared Bishop on d5. Idea is very nice but White maintains some
advantage because Black position is somehow passive.} 11. Nxd5 Bxd5 12. O-O Qd7
13. Qc2 f5 {Black maintains his light-squared block. His position is solid but
passive and in perspective White can play on c7 pawn. White position is a
little bit better.} 14. Bc4 h6 15. Qb3 Bxc4 16. Qxc4+ e6 {After exchange of
light-squared Bishops white take over the initiative. Now white have more
space and better develop pieces. Black dark-squared Bishop and Knight are
badly placed and potentially bad pawn on c7 can be very unpleasant for him.}

after the exchanges of light pieces White potentialy can have pressure against
the c7 pawn.} Rd5 25. g3 Rbd8 26. Qc3 R8d7 27. Be5 {Now White knows that
position is completely equal and the exchange of light pieces that has just
happen after whitch position is very drawish.} Nxe5 28. Nxe5 Rd8 29. f4 c6 30.
