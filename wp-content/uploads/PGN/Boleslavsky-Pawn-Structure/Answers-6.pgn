Usually, Black would like to attack on the kingside, but here the c2-pawn is
very weak and Black uses this fact. He played positionally and improved his
pieces before he performed his strategical breakthrough with e4. Please also
notice that he played the f-rook, keeping open the opportunity to open the
a-line.} 19. Rfc1 Qb7 {Black is putting a lot of pressure on the queenside and
the d5-pawn, forcing White to release the tension.} 20. a5 b5 21. Nb6 Nxb6 22.

bishops. The e3-pawn is dangerous and White has no active counterplay. After a

bishops pair; but, in this particular position, he cannot take advantage of a
