{In this position White is on the move. Try to evaluate the position. Who is
better?} 14. Nxe4 $1 {White is better. Why? White has already developed all of
his pieces and found very good squares for them. Black has some problems with
the devopment with the Knight on b8 and with the backward pawn on c7. With Ne4
White exchanges the best Black's piece.} dxe4 15. Ne5 $6 {Here this move is
not the best one. When you are better - you need to try not to exchange your
better pieces for opponent worse one. Now after Nd7 Black will exchange his
worst and undevelop piece and position will be very close to equal.} b5 $4 {A
very bad move. Black is worse and he needs to defend his position, but not to
attack the opponent.} (15... Nd7 $1 {The best option. Black exchanges a strong
Knight and is very close to the equality.}) 16. Rc5 Nd7 17. Nxd7 Qxd7 18. Qc2 {
Now you can see how Black's position is bad. Bishop on b7 is without of any
good squares and backward pawn on c7 is very bad. White has a huge positional
advantage.} Qd6 19. Rxc7 Rac8 20. Rc1 Qe6 21. Qd2 Rxc7 22. Rxc7 Bd5 23. b3 Qd6

{White is on the move. Who is better?} 9. Be2 {It is not easy to evaluate this
position. White has a litle advantage in the development, but black has a
litle bit more space on the queen-side. However, White is without weaknesses
and Black will have some problems on the king-side because of the pawn on g5
potentialy and also on ths queen-side maybe after b3, if White manages to
destroy Black's queen-side.} Bg7 10. Ne5 (10. b3 $1 {This is a better

Rxd4 {White is slightly better developed, however, on the other hand Black has
a Bishops' pair and White has some weaknesses on the king-side (h4 pawn) and
on the queen-side (c3, b4 pawns). Because of this Black is a litle bit better.
It is, first of all, very important to neutralize White's attack on the d file
with the Rooks exchange.} 21. Nxd4 e5 (21... Bd7 $5 {This is also a nice
option. Black developed last undeveloped piece and he wants to create attack
on the c3 pawn.}) 22. Nf3 Ng4 23. Rf1 Be6 {Now you can see that Black has
