{How do you think does Black needs to organyze the defense or not? Try to
figure out where and how Black needs to place and replace his pieces. Black's
turn.} 1... Ne8 {Black puts the Knight to e8 with an idea to defend e5 pawn
with f6 and Knight is a perfect defender for g7 square. Also after White's
idea of playing f4 and taking on e5, Black can take with d pawn and then bring
this Knight on a perfect square d6.} 2. f4 {A clear idea to open the center
and attack Black on the king-side.} Bd8 {A very nice defensive move, whic is
all about the chapter Economy in defense. Black relocate this bishop to active
b6 square and prepare 7th rank for the Rooks, if it will be necessery to
defend it.} 3. Kh2 {Nice move which doesn't allow Black to exchange of dark
squared bishops after Bb6.} Qc8 {Preparing the idea of Bb6.} 4. Qe2 {With this
move White connects the Rooks and prepare attack on thhe black King!} Bb6 5.
Rf1 {The idea is to bring the Rook in the attack on the black King with move
Rf1 - f3 - g3.} f6 {A very nice defensive move, it defends the pawn on e5 and
clear 7 rank for rooks.} 6. Nh5 Qd8 7. Rf3 Bc8 {Again a very nice defensive
move, which follows the idea of clearing 7 rank.} 8. Rg3 Kh8 9. f5 {White
closes the center and takes some space on the king-side.} Ra7 {Rook finaly
gets to be on the 7 rank and perfectly defends black King and the g7 square.}
10. Nf3 Nd7 {One more defensive move, Knight wants to go on f8 and Black wants
also to exchange darksquared Bishop.} 11. Bd2 {White can not allow this
exchange to happen, becouse without darksquared Bishop White doesn't have
enough pieces for the attack.} Nf8 12. Nh4 Qe7 {You can see how nice Black
plays in this position. Black has exactly enough pieces in the defense and
White can not make any progress in the attack, and on the other hand, Black
can with this economic defense use the rest of his piesec for achieveing the
progress on the queen-side with the moves like b4 and so on.} *

{What is here, in your opinion, the best move for Black? Black's turn.} 1... h5
{Black have very nicely placed pieces and with h5 he wants to stop White from
advancing on the king-side.} 2. N3h2 {White needs to defend his g4 pawn for a
moment.} hxg4 3. hxg4 Qc8 {Black wants to take the pawn on g4.} 4. f3 {White
defends it!} (4. g5 {This is not a good move because Black will open the
position on the king-side and White will not have enough pieces in the defense.
} Nh7 5. Qh5 g6 6. Qh4 f6 {Now Black opens the position and it is much better!}
7. gxf6 Nxf6 8. Nf3 Rf7 {Rook can go to h7 and all Black pieces can attack the
white King, which is without of any defense.}) 4... Nh7 {This is a very nice
move that stops White from advancing of the g pawn and prepares the trading of
the worst Black's piece for the best piece of White - the darksquared Bishop.}
5. Ng3 Bg5 {This is the idea.} 6. Nf5 {A very nice move! White attacks d6 pawn
and covers some of the bad squares on the king-side.} Qd8 {Black doesn't allow
Nd6, because of Qb6!} 7. Kg2 {White wants to take the h file. How Black needs
to proceed? Best Black's plan is to play g6 in order to get the white Knight
out of f5 and after that to move the King to g7. It is also possible to get
with the Rook from f8 to h8 and after this to prepare the strong idea of
playing on the dark squares. Qf6 maybe to f4 and so on...} (7. Nxd6 Qb6 $17)
7... g6 8. Ng3 Kg7 9. Rh1 Rh8 10. Nhf1 Qf6 11. Be3 Bxe3 12. Nxe3 {Now you can
see how Black plan works perfectly. After occupying dark squares Black will
aslo be a little bit better.} Ng5 13. Qe2 Rag8 14. Raf1 Qf4 {Black occupied
dark squares and he has a better position. Here black economically exchanges
darksquared Bishops and bring all of his pieces on perfect suares not only for
the defense but also for the offense.} *

{The White's idea is to play h4 and open h file for the attack on the black
King. How Black can defend it? Black's turn.} 1... Bh4 {The main idea of White
is to play h4 and h5 in order to oppen the h file for the attack. With Bh4
Black stops this and also wants to exchange the great white darksquared Bishop.
} 2. Bg3 {White doesn't want to trade this Bishop, and he plays this move
because Black cannot take the Bishop because it will open the h file.} N8g7 {
Black very economically brings his pieces in to the play. The idea is to cover
the squares on f5 and h5 and after exchanging of the Knight on e6 the other
black Knight can come to his position.} 3. Qd2 Re8 {A nice defensive and
attacking move. Black brings the Rook on the half open e file and for a moment
alows the Knight, if it will be necessery, to come on f8.} 4. Qe1 {A nice
attacking move. White needs to attack Black. With Qe1 White wants to open the
h file eventually.} Bf6 {Another nice move. Black retreat with the Bishop and
prepares that piece for the defense of the dark squares around his King (g7
and h8) .} 5. Qf2 Qe7 6. h4 {White attack.} Nxf4 {One more very nice defensive
move. Black take attacking piece on f4, after whitch  he will bring other
Knight to e6 and the Bishop will stay on this vital defensive diagonal.} 7.
Bxf4 Ne6 8. g5 Nxf4 9. Nxf4 Bg7 {Now you can see the point. Black perfectly
cover all the squares around the king with the darksquared Bishop and now can
use other pieces for even attack on the white King on the queen-side.} 10. Rde1
Qd6 {The next move will be c5 and black is better. His King is perfectly safe
and it is very hard for White to organize attack on the black King.} *

{White is on the move and he plays Re4! Great attacking move! What do you
think? Is White much better? Can White mate black King or Black has enough
resources for the defense? How do you think, in which way Black needs to
defend? Where does he need to put his pieces?} 1. Re4 {It seems like White has
a strong attack on the black King. All of the White's pieces attack black King.
But if you look at it carefully, you will see that Black is also defending
himself with all pieces he needs. After Re4 idea is to bring the Rook to the h
file and the Knight on g5 and the Queen to h5.} Nce7 {Economic defense! Knight
from c6 comes to defense!} 2. Nxd5 Nxd5 3. Rh4 g6 {A nice move that does not
allow White's Queen to get to the h5 square and Black does not need to bring
his perfect Knight from d5 to defense on f6 if there is no need to do this.} 4.
Rxc8 Qxc8 5. Ng5 {Now White wants to take the h7 pawn.} Be7 {A great defensive
move. There is no need to play h5 and potentially allowing White to sacrfice
some piece on h5.} 6. Qg4 {White wants to bring the Queen to h3 and attack h7
pawn once again.} h5 {Now this is the tempo. Black doesn't not alow White to
take on h7 and makes White get his Queen from g4.} 7. Qg3 Qb8 {Now once again
you can see perfect economic defense. Black defends himself only with the
pieces that he needs. After of the excahnge of the Queens White will not have
any attacking chances and all of his pieces will be on the wrong side of the
board.} *

{What do you think Black needs to play here? White wants to attack Black with
f4. Can the black Knight stay on e5? And what is the future of this Knight?
Where do you think Black needs to move this knight?And how to organyze some
counter-chances? Black's turn.} 1... Nd7 {This is a very nice defensive move!
Black wants to transfer the Knight to f8, from where it will defend the
potentially endangered h7 square.} 2. Rad1 a5 {Nice move. Black wants to get
this Bishop from the attacking b3 square and also maybe later on to play Ra5.}
3. c3 a4 4. Bc2 {White tries to relocate the Bishop to c2 and with next move
Qh3 to attack h7 square.} Re8 {Nice move. Rook plays great role on the half
open e file and removes from f8 square, allowing the Bishop or the Knight to
move there.} 5. Qh3 {Now you can see the point. White wants to attack the h7
square.} Nf8 {And the Knight is on f8. The Knight is perfectly placed. This
piece defends the vital h7 square and secure the black King. Black defend
himself very economically. Only with the Knight on f8.} 6. Be3 Qa5 7. a3 Qb5 {
One more perfect move following the idea of the economic defense. Black use
only the Knight for the defense and all other pieces for the counter-play.} *
