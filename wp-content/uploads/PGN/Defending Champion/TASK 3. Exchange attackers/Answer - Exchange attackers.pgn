14... Qf6 $1 {If the exchange of the dark-squared bishops plays a significant
role in rendering the Semi-Tarrasch defence playable, the exchange of Queens
would suit Black even better. His potential pressure against White's center
and against the queen-side majority constitute significant assets for which
dynamic compensation needs to be sought on the king-side and keeping the
centre mobile.} (14... Rc8 $5) (14... Na5 $5) (14... Ne7 $5) 15. Qe3 Rac8 16.
e5 $6 {White overestimates the dynamic chances which he will be able to
generate as compensation for this unfortunate fixing of his center. The move
clearly stands guilt of enhancing Black's chances on the light-squares (the
a8-h1 diagonal in particular). Moreover, Ribli's well-judged reply takes the
sting out of any attacking hopes which White might have entertained.} Qh6 17.

24. Ne5 {With Ne5 White has some pressure on the Black's king-side! This
Knight is the best white piece! What now Black needs to do?} Ne8 $1 {A
super-defensing move. And then computer will make an attacking move. Black
does the regrouping and exchnaging of the most powerful piece - the Knight on
e5. Idea is to protect the g7 square with the Knight and get this Knight away
from f6 square because of the idea of f6! And Black pushes away this Knight
neutralyzing White's presure on diagonale a1-h8!} (24... Na4 {In the actual
game Black played slightly inaccurate move. Knight on e5 is a strong piece and
with the Queen and the Bishop on a1-h8 diagonal makes some presure on black
King.}) 25. g4 Rc8 26. Bd4 Bd6 27. Qc3 Bxe5 28. Bxe5 f6 $1 {And you can see
