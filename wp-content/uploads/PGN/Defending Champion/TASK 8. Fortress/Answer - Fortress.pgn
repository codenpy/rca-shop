{Black's turn. It looks like that Black has one very bad Knight and with pawn
dawn needs a miracle to save the game! First of all Black try to make a threat
to the Bishop and f3 pawn.} 41... Ng5 42. Bd5 bxc3 $1 {If we defende in the
endgame we need to exchnage the pawns. As less pawns are in the board so easy
will be for us to achive the draw. Thus, the last move is very important.} 43.
bxc3 Kc5 44. Bb7 Kd6 $1 {Black will regroup his pieces. Black's King will go
to the queen-side in order to stop the very dangerous "g" pawn and the Knigh
will go to c5. The White cannot do something to stop Black's plan.} 45. Kb2 Ne6
46. Ka3 Nc5 $1 {This is a very powerfull fortress.White cannot come inside.
The Knight is corporating exelent with the pawn pawns. Pawns are controlling
the dark squares and the Knight is controlling the light squares.} 47. Be4 Ke7

dangerous for White to start pushing the pawns. I'd like to let you know that
it was a blitz game, so players didn't have plenty of time to think. In any
case the draw is a fair result.} 1/2-1/2

Carlsen has a very pleasant position with the Bishop pair advantage. His next
move is a very bad one because White can achieve a fortress and Black cannot
do anything to break it. Here is the critical position and a golden
opportunity for Magnus to break Karjakin's defense. Indeed, Black has a lot of
options like f4, capture on g4 and Be6. The best reply is Be6. This will force
White to capture on f5 and Black can recapture with the King. After that,
Black's pieces will be more active and he will be ready to start pushing his
g-pawn with the help of the two Bishops. The g-pawn is not the only White's
problem. Black has another interesting plan. He can use the g-pawn as a decoy
in order to keep White's pieces busy, and after that, he can organize an
attack on the queenside. He can try to capture all the queenside weak pawns,
starting from b2.} f4 $6 {This is the critical mistake. After this move,
Carlsen cannot win any more.} (45... Be6) 46. Bd4 Bc7 47. Nf2 Be6 48. Kf3 Bd5+
