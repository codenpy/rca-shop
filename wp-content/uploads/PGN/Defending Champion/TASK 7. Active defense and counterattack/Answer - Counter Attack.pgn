Ivanchuk tries to create complications at any costs.} hxg5 11. fxg5 {Black's
turn.} b4 $1 {If the position is approximately equal and your opponent tries
to attack your King, then it is necessary to counterblow; now both Knights are
kicked off from the center. Black's plan is to attack the Knight and then
capture the pawn to e4.} (11... Nfd7 $2 12. g6 $1) (11... Nh5 $2 12. O-O Qd7

dangerous attack, but this variation was preferable from the game continuation.
}) 13. O-O Nd7 14. g6 Nhf6 {Black tries to close the lines around his King. In
the Sicilian, Black's King may stay in the center of the board, instead of the
short castling. Thus, more important than to castle is to protect the King
with the pieces. This strategy is a very risky one. On the other hand, White
pieces are very active here and he manages to play g6. The move g6 is the most
critical attacking move which can create a lot of problems for the Black's
King.} 15. c3 Ne5 (15... Qe7 $5 {This is a very interesting alternative. Queen
is the most powerful defensive piece, so it is logical to put it close to the
King.} 16. Qb3 d5 17. exd5 Bxd5 18. Bxd5 exd5 19. Rae1 $18) 16. gxf7+ Kxf7 17.

cover the King with the Bishop to d5. Black who pinned the g2 Bishop will
capture it in the next move.} 22. Rxf6 {Here 22... gxf6 fails to 23.Ng5+} Rxg2+
