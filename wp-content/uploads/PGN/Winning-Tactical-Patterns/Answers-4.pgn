pieces. The queen and the c6-knight are under attack now.} (23. b4 $5) (23. Ne1

{This intermediate move was very important in order to save the bishop and win
material.} Kf8 26. Rxa4 $18) 25. Bxd5+ {White has a material advantage now.
This is a very important winning factor as GM Igor Smirnov already taught you
in the course "Winning the Middlegame".} Kh8 26. Qb5 $1 {This is a very
accurate move because it stops b5. Black's position is cramped, White has the
bishop pair, and Black is looking for counterplay. Maybe he resigns too early,
but practically it is a matter of time until White increases his superiority.}

The line is very forcing and White should be accurate. Black has many problems:
the knight on a6 is out of the game, the back rank is vulnerable and the queen
is under attack. White's pieces are perfectly coordinated and, for that reason,
he can deliver strong tactics.} (26. Rxf6 $5 gxf6 27. Na7 $36) (26. Na7 $5)

Kg8 40. Nxc1 Qd4 41. Bd2 $1 {This is the only move to keep the initiative;
hopefully, you had foreseen it in advance. White is intending to play the
bishop to c3 and create huge problems on the weakened dark squares around the
black king. Black doesn't have a decisive attack or perpetual check.} Qg1+ 42.
Kg3 Rd1 43. Bc3 {The bishop plays a very important role because it can support
the attack on g7 and, similarly, it protects the e1-square from potential
checks. Black resigned here.} 1-0

a material advantage. In order to do that, he should be careful with the move
order. First things first, he exchanged queens in order to dominate Black's
back rank. Similarly, the exchange of the queens had a defensive character

White has a clear advantage here because he is a healthy pawn up, the e1-rook
is active, and the knight is superior to the bishop. The bishop is limited by
the d4-pawn and the knight successfully blockaded the d4-pawn. White manages
to win the game afterward.} Rd7 32. Ne5 Rb7 33. Rxd4 Bxb4 34. Rg4+ Kf6 35. Rf4+
