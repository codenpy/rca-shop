$1 {This is a very strong move wit a good tactical intuition. White's idea is
to increase his central control and get closer to Black's monarch. The
g4-knight is very strong and, after it's elimination, White will increase his
influence in his light squares. Please notice that in many lines the queen
from g4 is eyeballing the c8-rook and the g7-bishop.} (20. exd6 $5 exd6 21. Kb1

Qxf5 Kg8 $14 (26... Qxg2 27. Be4 $1)) 22. Ne4 {White brings more pieces with
tempo to the center and closer to Black's king. The c2-pawn is protected
sufficiently because he d3-bishop is doing a fantastic job.} Qc6 23. exd6 $1 {
White has better development and, for that reason, he continues to open the
center. The pawn on e7 is under attack because the king cannot protect g7 and
e7 at the same time. Similarly, the knight cannot capture on d6 because the
queen should protect d6 and the rook on c8. Thus, White creates tactical
problems for Black.} f5 $2 (23... Nxc2 {This is a possible continuation, but
everything is under control. Black doesn't have any good discovered attack and
one of the possible ways is to play Kb1, and then White could use the c-file
by the Rc1 move.} 24. dxe7+ (24. Kb1 $5 $18) 24... Kxe7 25. Qxg7 Ne1+ 26. Bc3

defense for Black. White's position is preferable because his bishops are more
active, the pair of rooks are in the game and White's king is safer compared
to Black.}) 24. Qg6 {Another very strong and precise move. White continues his
domination on the light squares. Black's main problem is the unsafe and
uncastled king. This means that the rooks are not connected.} fxe4 25. dxe7+ {
Another key move with the idea to distract Black's king from the protection of
the bishop on g7. The second idea behind it is to promote the pawn into a new
