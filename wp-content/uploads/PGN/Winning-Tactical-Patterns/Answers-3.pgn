the b5-bishop, he captured on f4. The knights are very useful in this pawn

the e7-knight, and the f4-rook.} (20. Nxf4 Qxf4 21. Rfe1 $16) 20... Ng6 21. Be8

hanging. Did you manage to spot the second move?} Kh7 40. Kf3 $1 {This is the
key point in the combination. The f5-knight is still untouchable and White
opens the h-file. The idea is to drive the enemy king into a bad square in

very passive and almost all of Black's pawns are on the light squares. This
means that the pawns will limit the activity of the bishop.} Rxd4 27. Nb3 {
Black was threatening to retreat the knight, but now he created the scenario
of a good knight against a bad bishop. Please also notice that c5 is a
powerful outpost for the knight, that can exert pressure against the a6-pawn.

position.}) (26. Kh2 $6 Ne6 $17) 26... Ne2+ 27. Kh1 fxe4 28. g3 Rd3 $19 {
