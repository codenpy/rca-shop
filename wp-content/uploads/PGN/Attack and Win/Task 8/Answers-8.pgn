The best move in the position. White performs the final killing blow. The
knight cannot capture because it's pinned; so, the king is forced to recapture.
By this brilliant exchange rook sacrifice, White opens up the position of the
king. Please also notice that White has a piece superiority on the kingside
and he can bring the pieces there very fast. Black cannot do the same, bring a
lot of defenders.} (19. Bd3 $5) (19. Bc4 $5) 19... Kxh7 20. Qxf6 {White has a
good position because his queen is extremely active, covering squares around
the enemy king. White can bring the rook to h1, and the g6-pawn is weak.} Qg7
21. Ng5+ Kh8 22. Qf4 $1 {This is a very important attacking rule: While you're
attacking, you need to keep the queens on the board. The Be2 isn't important
because White would like to win time for the attack.} Rxe2 23. Rh1+ Kg8 24.
Qc4+ {White will collect back the rook on e2 and he has a winning position.
White won the game smoothly.} d5 25. Qxe2 Qf6 26. Qe3 Rd8 27. Nh7 Qd6 28. Qg5

White has plenty of good options, but he would like to activate his pieces and
focus them on the kingside. Usually, the bishop pair is an advantage; but he
gives it away, by capturing on e5, in order to win the fight for the c4-square.

From there, it will execute pressure on h7 and f7. From g5, the knight can
cooperate very well with the h1-rook and the bishop on c4. As you can see,
White's pieces have a target and they are cooperating. Similarly, they are
focusing on one area of the board, the kingside.} b5 16. Bb3 {

The Closed Sicilian is a very tricky system to meet. White controls the center
solidly and, step by step, he will start building his kingside attack. Black
has the illusion that he can control the d4-square (actually, he controls it),
but on this square he cannot do anything. In most of the cases, Black placed a
knight on d4, but this knight is not coordinated with the remaining pieces; so,
it's not dangerous. Please also notice that already White manages to play f5
and this is very favorable forhim!} (13. Nh4 $5) (13. Bf4 $5) (13. Be3 $5)
13... Ne5 14. Nf4 Nxf3+ 15. Qxf3 {After the exchange of the knights, White
increased his superiority on the kingside, and he is ready to continue
building his attack there. White is controlling well the center, the d3 and
e4-pawns are restricting the bishop on b7.} b4 16. h4 {White has a fantastic
space advantage on the queenside, but his pieces are not supporting the pawns,
and this is a problem. On the other hand, White has a lot of pieces on the
kingside. His pawns are ready to perform the g5 advancement, but White needs
to prepare it with his pieces. In chess, as in life, you need to be patient.
First, White should prepare it and then perform it.} Bd6 17. Qf2 Rb8 18. Be3
Qe7 19. Rae1 Nb5 20. Nh5 {White has the initiative here because his pieces are
on the kingside and they are preparing the attack. The computer assesses this
position as equal, but White has a clear breakthrough, the g5. It's a little
more difficult to suggest good and active plans for Black. White manages to
win the game afterwards.} Nd4 21. Bf4 Bxf4 22. Nxf4 Nc6 23. Re3 Ne5 24. Rg3 Nf7

The exclamation mark isn't for the move itself but for the plan! White is
preparing to open the kingside position with the h4 move. The queen will go to
c2, and then White can double the rooks on the h-file. By this plan, White
creates a stronger army on the kingside. The real problem for Black, the
strategical problem, is that he cannot create any active counterplay or a
stronger army on the other side of the board.} (20. Qc2 $5) (20. h4 $5 {This
is interesting, but it's better to prepare this move with your pieces before
playing it.}) 20... Nh7 21. Qc2 Rb7 22. Be3 {White just continues with his
preparation moves. It's very difficult, or impossible, for Black to play b5...}
Qf6 23. h4 {Everything was ready for the breakthrough, and White finally
performed it.} gxh4 24. Bf2 {The h4-pawn is doomed. Black cannot protect it
sufficiently. And please also note how, step by step, White is creating a
stronger army on the kingside.} Ng5 25. Rxh4 Qd8 26. Rbh1 $16 {White performed
his plan and, as you can understand, he is totally protecting the e4-square.
Black cannot play easily the b5 break, the h6-pawn is weak, the g5 knight
looks OK, but it doesn't coordinate with the remain pieces. So, White is ready
to continue building his attack on the kingside, the side where he has a
stronger army. He manages to win the game afterwards.} f6 27. Be3 b5 28. axb5
