Black tries to put his pieces there and then to open lines. Similarly, you can
see here that White's queen is on the queenside, and this means that it cannot
help on the kingside defense. Black didn't play the most accurate move, but a
brave one for sure, sacrificing his knight in order to open up the lines
brutally.} (15... Rh6 $5) 16. dxc5 Bxf3 {Black is able to destroy White's pawn

difficult to play defensive moves instead of attacking moves.}) 17... Rg6 18.

has compensation for his sacrificed pawn because his pieces are extremely

the light squares.} Qh4 19. Qb4 Qh5 {Of course, it's important to keep the
