very strong idea. White keep building in the center and tries to prove that
Bb7 is a bad piece. He is putting pressure on the e6 pawn and on the a1-h8
diagonal.} (19. f3 $5) (19. e3 $5) (19. b4 $5) (19. Ra1 $5) (19. dxc5 $5) 19...

against the kingside.}) 20. e4 {White is dominating in the center and he is
ready to continue to expand his space advantage with the f4 or b4 breaks.
Similarly, please note that b7-bishop is out of the game.} Nf8 21. f4 {White
manages to perform his thematic breakthrough. Black's pieces are not ready to
open the center. Black cannot capture on f4, and all of the options are open
for White. You can see how strong is the pressure against the e5-pawn.} N6d7
22. Nf3 $16 {White has a big advantage because his pieces are active by
pressing the e5 pawn. The next step is to control the "a" and "f" files with
the rooks. Black's pieces are inactive on the back ranks. White used the
advantages of his position, and he won the game afterwards.} Re8 23. Rf1 f6 24.

Nfd7 9. Be3 Nb6 {Diagram #} 10. Qc5 $5 {Black didn't play the more active move,
8...b5, but he retreats immediately with the knight on d7. Now White is
controlling the center very well and Black cannot play Bb7 in order to control
the d5-square. White's queen will stay on the a3-f8 diagonal in order to block
the liberating c5 move. After the center domination, White will start thinking
on how to attack on the kingside.} (10. Qb4 $5) (10. Qe2 $5) (10. Qd3 $5) 10...
Be6 11. Ng5 {White is attacking the bishop, threatening to double Black's
pawns on e7-e6. He is preparing the Ne4 maneuver, and brings a new piece to
the kingside. Sooner or later, White will play h4-h5.} Bf5 12. Be2 Kh8 13. g4 {
This and the h4 moves are typical. However, it's more practical to attack
something; for example, your opponent's pieces.} Bc8 14. O-O-O {The king goes
to a safe place, the queenside, because it's difficult for Black to open the
center or lines on the queenside. Similarly, White's rooks are connected, and
White can continue his strategy to open up Black's kingside with h4-h5.} f6 15.
Nge4 f5 16. gxf5 Bxf5 17. h4 {White starts bringing more pieces to the
kingside. The white pieces are active behind the strong center, and Karpov
manages to win the game afterwards.} N8d7 18. Qa3 Nd5 19. Ng5 $36 {White start
bringing more piece in the kingside. The White pieces are active behind the

Bc3 Na6 {Diagram #} 16. e4 $5 {The main question here is if you play e4
immediately or bring the knight into the game first with Nc2. The doubled
pawns on a line are not scary because White will have open lines on the
queenside. For that reason, White took the decision to advance his pawns to
the center. If you open up the computer, it will suggest a lot of
approximately equal moves here. You need to follow the rule "play in the
center". Please, also notice that the a6 knight is out of the game.} (16. Nc2

but he would like to break the f4 blockade and advance this pawn forward.

attack on the kingside.} gxh4 18. e5 Nd7 19. f4 $36 {White's center and the

order to do that, he should advance his pawns. The c3 move is on purpose, and
it's a very typical idea. In many systems, in order to advance the pawns on e4
and d4, White perform this idea by playing c3 first.} (9. Nb3 $5) (9. a4 $5) (

White continues with his plan, to grab more space in the center.} Bb6 11. e5 {

solid position; and the next step is to attack on the kingside.} Nd7 12. Rd1 {
It's awayls a good idea to place your rook against the opponent's queen or
king because it creates tactical motifs.} dxe5 13. dxe5 bxc3 14. bxc3 Qc8 15.

positional move. White closes the center and limits the activity of the
b7-bishop. Please, also notice how badly placed is the a5-knight; a usual
problem of the Spanish opening. White would like to use his positional and
space advantages in order to start attacking on the kingside.} (12. Nbd2 $5) (

attacking on the kingside, White takes more space on the queenside and he is
trying to block the position there. White's plan is to continue attacking
without facing counterplay on the queenside. For that reason, he plays a4 in
order to limit the options of Black's pawns.} Qc7 15. Na3 b4 16. a5 {
