O-O {Diagram #} (8... c6 9. f3 d5) 9. f3 $1 {White has plenty of good moves
available, but he should do something in order to activate his pieces. Black
started a very brutal attack without developing his pieces first. Similarly,
he didn't protect his e4-pawn with c6 and d5. Maybe the e4-pawn is the only
asset in his position. For that reason, White started to attack this pawn in
order to liberate the center. The pawn push on e3 looks scary, but the black
pieces cannot protect this pawn because his pieces are not active and ready
for such operations.} (9. a4 $5) (9. Qb3 $5) (9. e3 $5) (9. b3 $5) 9... e3 $6
10. Nb3 f4 11. gxf4 Nb6 12. Na5 $5 {Black sacrifices a pawn and he is trying
really hard, but White's last move, a rather sadistic, put an end at his
dreams. White stops the complications, protects the c4-pawn and is ready to
capture on e3. This is a very typical scenario when someone starts an early
and brutal attack without good preparation of the pieces.} (12. Bxe3 $5 Nxc4
13. Bc1 $14) 12... Nh5 13. Bxe3 Nxf4 14. Bxf4 {This is another very practical
move, try to attack the dangerous attacking pieces. The knight is usually a
dangerous piece. After this exchange, White's like to win sometime in order to
place his pawns on dark squares. He can do that by attacking the enemy rook.
He'd like to do it by following Capablanca's rule: when you have light-squared
bishop, then put your pawns on dark squares.} Rxf4 15. e3 Rf5 16. b4 {
White is forced to protect his knight. Black can create threats here and there,
but sooner or later the threats will stop! In similar situations, you need to
be patient and alert.} d5 (16... c5 17. dxc5 dxc5 18. Qxd8+ Bxd8 19. Rad1 $16)
17. c5 Rg5 18. f4 Rg6 {Diagram #} 19. Kh1 $6 {Here is another very critical
moment for White. White has a very good position, solid central control and a
pawn up! However, the position isn't won yet, and we need to find some good
moves. White played some good moves, but these moves are isolated and without
a clear plan. White's plan here is to stop the Bh3 move and try to open the
position. It's really important for White to open the center because he will
liberate his pieces.} (19. Qb3 $6 Bh3 (19... Nc4 20. Nxc4 dxc4 21. Qxc4+ Be6

the rook and blocks the c8-bishop. Black's queen is blocked, and this is in
White's favour.} Rg5 20. e4 $1 $16) 19... c6 20. a3 $6 {Another very slow move.
White is threatening to capture the knight and his b4-pawn is protected.
However, such moves give time to Black to consolidate his position and create
new threats.} Nd7 21. Nb3 $6 {This is the last insurance in White's series of
inaccuracies. Now it was almost impossible for White to find the best move, e4,
because he didn't think actively while playing 19.Kh1. The position is about
equal, or we can say that Black has counterplay because he has a stronger army
on the kingside. White manages to win the game afterwards, but both players
missed the 32.Rh3 move!} (21. e4 $1 dxe4 22. Nxe4 Nf6 23. Qb3+ Kh8 24. Ng5 $18)

equal thanks to the opposite-colored bishops. However, things are not so
simple because both players have the heavy pieces on the board. The b-pawn
isn't dangerous right now, but Black should be careful because White is
threatening to organize his pieces and then push it. As I mentioned, the heavy
pieces make the game more complicated because the side with the initiative can
create some attacking chances. This is the reason why Black keeps the queens
on the board in order to create attacking posibilities.} (40... Qxd3 $6 41.

tried to improve the situation. The idea behind Be5 is to free the f-pawn.} (
