gxf6 Bf8 16. Rg1 h5 17. Rg7 Nd7 {Diagram #} 18. e5 $1 {This is an exciting
position of the Nadjorf variation. White played very aggressively and oferred
material. The black king is uncaslted and it is trying to find a safeguard
behind his pawn shield and pieces in the center. However, this is a dangerous
strategy, and White has a lot of tactical posibilities to open up the position,
as he did in this particular game.} (18. Nxe6 $3 {This is another amazing
attacking posibility in order to open Black's king position. The problem for
Black is that he didn't manage to coordinate his pieces, and his rooks are
unprotected in the corners.} fxe6 19. f7+ Kd8 (19... Ke7 20. Rg6 $1 {Another in
credible move. White is threatening to sacrifice his rook on e6 to continue
opening up Black's position.} Rh6 21. Rxe6+ Rxe6 (21... Kxe6 22. Nd5 $18) 22.

good idea to place the queen opposite to the king. White is aiming to open the
position and strike the e6-pawn.} (19. Qg3 $5) 19... dxe5 20. Nxe6 $5 {
White continues opening up the position because the opponent king is there.
The material isn't very important right now because Black cannot activate his
rooks quickly.} (20. Bg2 $5 {This is another interesting move in order to win
a tempo and develop the attack.}) 20... fxe6 21. Bg2 $18 {White has a winning
advantage thanks to his very active pieces, Black's uncastled king and
destroyed Black's pawn structure. He manages to win the game afterwards.} (21.

decision to open up the center. He had done this by sacrificing a piece. This
was a correct decision in order to open up the game and lines for the
remaining pieces.} (14. Nxd5 $5) (14. Ng3 $5) (14. Qh6 $5) 14... exd5 15. Nf4+

now. By keeping the enemy king in the center of the board you don't allow him
to finalize the development and the rooks remain unconnected.} Kd8 16. Nfxd5

that he didn't make a sacrifice on d5 because he took the material back.} Qc6

all the attacks lead to checkmate; thus, it was better for White to collect
material by capturing on f7. However, he continues hunting the enemy king.
This gives Black some time; so, he finaly manages to win the game!} (19. Qxf7

Nxf7 {A very beautiful looking move. White would like to keep the enemy king
in the center. Black's pieces are disorganized and Black will not find time to
secure the safety of his king. White has a very active position and performs
strong threats with his pieces. This is the strategy you should follow: to
have very active pieces and generate threats when you sacrifice a piece. If
the enemy pieces are disorganized, then create threats in order not to give
him time to consolidate his position.} (14. Bb5+ $5) 14... Kxf7 15. O-O-O {
White almost finalizes his development, and it's extremely dangerous for Black
to capture the d5-pawn.} Bd6 16. Nh4 Bc8 17. Re1 {Now we can start to see the
first symptoms of the sacrificed piece. White's pieces are active and they try
to attack and generate threats. Black only defends himself. Black's king isn't
secure and it's always very difficult to play a game without a safe king.
Black's rooks are inactive and Black needs some tempi in order to finalize his
development.} Na6 18. Re6 {White continues the game very brutally! By such
moves, you can gain a lot of new fans, am I right? Black cannot accept the
sacrificed rook because the a6-knight will be unprotected.} Nb4 (18... Bxe6 19.

Topalov manages to win the game afterwards. He achieved that thanks to Black's
disorganized pieces and his very strong threats.} (19. Qg6+ $1 {It was better
to give a check on g6, bringing the queen closer to the enemy king.}) 19...

Bb7 9. O-O b4 {Diagram #} 10. Nd5 $1 {An amazing and very typical piece
sacrifice. White sacrifices his knight in order to open the e-line and start
attacking the black king. With this sacrifice, White is protecting his e4-pawn.
Black is facing problems on the e-line and the c5- and f5-squares.} (10. Na4
Bxe4 $15) (10. Nce2 $6 Bxe4 $15) (10. g5 $5) 10... exd5 11. exd5 Be7 12. g5 {

give him time to finalize his development.} (12. Nf5 O-O 13. Re1 Re8 {
Black feels comfortable here because his king is in safety.}) 12... Nfd7 13.
Nc6 $5 {White continues his attack with venom and by gaining tempi from every
move. You can gain tempi by attacking the enemy pieces. This is the correct
strategy because it doesn't give much time to Black to organize his defense
and complete his development.} (13. Re1 $5) 13... Qc7 (13... Bxc6 14. dxc6 Nb6

White continues not giving time to Black to finalize his development.} Kxe7 15.
Qd4 Kf8 (15... Rg8 {This was an alternative, but a very passive move. Black's
king is still in the center and he faces problems.}) 16. Bf4 $44 {White has com
pensation for the sacrificed piece because he is pressing the d6 weakness; he
has a better piece development and cooperation. On the other hand, Black's
rooks are not connected, there is not an obvious way to develop the b8-knight
and he king on f8 is not sitting very well. The h8-rook is out of the game.
White manages to win the game afterwards.} a5 17. Rfe1 Nb6 18. Re8+ Kxe8 19.
