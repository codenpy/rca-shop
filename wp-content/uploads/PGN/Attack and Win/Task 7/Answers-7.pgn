Diagram #} Bc8 $5 {Usually, in the King Indian Defense, White creates a strong
attack on the queenside, but Black has the oportunity to attack on the
kingside. Black gives a pawn in order to win time for the attack. Black would
like to play g4 as quickly as possible.} (21... a6) 22. Nxd6 cxd6 23. Bxa7 Bd7
24. Bf2 Rxa1 25. Qxa1 {Diagram #} g4 {Here Black performed his idea. The game
is strategically winning on the queenside and, if White has time, then he can
advance his passed pawn. However, right now, he is in great danger, and he
should defend on the kingside against Black's strong initiative.} 26. Qe1 Kg7
27. Qb4 g3 {This wasn't the best move according to the computer, but it does
one thing, wins time fo Black's attack. You can win time by attacking the
enemy pieces.} 28. hxg3 fxg3 29. Bxg3 h4 {
This is another attacking move, forcing the dark-squared bishop to go back.}
30. Bh2 Nh5 {White is two pawns up and the computer gives him a big plus.
However, things are not so simple in chess because all of Black's pieces are
concentrating on the kingside and they are ready to occupy the f4 and
g3-squares. Black can play the breaktrhough h3 move and the queen can come to
g5, supporting the attack. Another plan is to activate the rook from the
a-line and protect the d6-pawn with the queen. In similar situations, your
opponent can make a mistake, even if he is a very strong player...} 31. Kg1 Ng3
32. Rf2 Qe7 33. Bf1 Ra8 $5 {Black has here full compensation for the
sacrificed pawns. The threat is Ra8 in order to create a pin on the f1-bishop.
White manages to win the game after some moves thanks to his very active and
aggressive pieces.} 34. Qc3 Bb5 35. Nxe5 dxe5 36. Bxb5 Ra1+ 0-1

Similarly, White is threatening to play h5 in order to capture the e5-pawn;
but Black ignores these threats. On the contrary, Black starts the attack on

to exchange queens. He doesn't like to recapture the sacrificed pawn
immediately, but to continue with the attack. Black's queen is a tactical
target, and White will use it in order to activate his rooks.} (20. Qc2 $5) (

White manages to take two tempi by attacking the queen.} Qc2 25. Qh5 $1 {
White is sacrificing another pawn on a2 in order to bring the queen into the
attack. The position is very critical for Black because Black's king could
feel lonely without friendly pieces around him. The position is dynamically
equal here because Black can grab material, but White has very active pieces.
After a long fight, the white player manages to win the game.} Kh8 26. R4f2 Qe4
