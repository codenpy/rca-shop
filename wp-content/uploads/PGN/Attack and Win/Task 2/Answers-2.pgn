19. gxh5 Nxh5 20. Rg5 e5 {Diagram #} 21. Nf5 $1 {This is a fantastic attacking
move. White uses the momentum in order to create attacking moves. He would
like to exchange a new defender, the g7-bishop. By attacking moves, he doesn't
allow his opponent to create counterplay with the a4 move. Black made an
unsound exchange sacrifice, but White should play actively and aggressively.} (
21. Ne2 a4 $132 {If White plays careless, then Black can grab the initiative
because his kingside attack has stopped. For that reason, it was necessary for
White to play aggressive and attacking moves, like Nf5.}) (21. Rxh5 gxh5 22.

that White has the advantage but, in the real game, Black's central control is
annoying and it can give counterplay to Black.}) 23... a4 24. fxg6 {An important
attacking move. White would like to weaken Black's kingside position even
more. As you can see in the sub-variation, Black cannot just recapture on g6
with the pawn because White will create a powerful pin over the g7-bishop.} Ne6

A winning position thanks to the powerful pin on the g-line.}) 25. gxf7+ {
You should be training your eye in order to find similar counterattacking
moves. The g5-rook is under attack, but White is threatening the king.} Rxf7
26. Rg3 {White is clearly better because the pin over the g7-bishop is
annoying and White can increase the pressure by Rhg1. Similarly, the problem
is that Black's knight doesn't have a good outpost.} Kh8 27. Qc4 {A double atta
ck on the knight on e6 and the a4-pawn; so, White expands his material
advantage.} d5 28. Qxa4 d4 29. Bd2 b5 30. Qxb5 Qa8 31. Rf1 {It's important to

pieces closer to the kingside in order to start the attack there. Other moves
are available as well, but if you want to create a succesful attack, then you
need to bring your queen opposite to the enemy king.} (16. Qc3 $5) (16. c4 $5)
(16. Ra5 $5) (16. Qe2 $5) 16... d5 17. Qh4 {White starts bringing pieces
towards Black's kingside. The next step in the plan is to double the rooks on
the e-line, play Bf4 and start attacking. As you can see in the game, by
bringing the queen to h4, White isn't in a hurry to play Ng5 and create a
temporary attack. He is bulding his attack slowly by activating all of his
pieces.} h6 18. Rfe1 {Please also notice that White is creating positional
threats. Right now, he is threatening a pawn sacrifice with e6 in order to cut
Black's position into two.} Qe6 19. Re3 a5 20. Rae1 a4 21. Bf4 $5 {
He is creating a direct threat to weaken Black's kingside pawn formation.} (21.

for the remaining heavy pieces. The computer suggests that Black can hold this
position, but it's very unpleasant to play it with Black during a real chess
game because you need to find very accurate moves.} hxg5 23. Bxg5 {Black doesn'
t have time to carry on his counterplay with a pawn. In light of that, the
a8-rook will never be active. White achieved that position by attacking moves.}
Nc8 24. Rg3 f5 $2 {This is an error and Black lost afterwards because White
created a powerful pin over the g7-bishop.} (24... Nd6 {This is an amazing
move in order to create the Nf5 threat. This is working because the rook on e1
is unprotected.} 25. exd6 (25. Bxe7 Nf5 26. Bf6 Nxh4 27. Rxg7+ Kh8 28. Rxf7+ {
And the game is a draw thanks to the windmill tactical motif.}) 25... Qxe1+ 26.
Kh2 f6 27. Bh6 Rf7 28. Qg4 {The position is still complicated, but Black is
not losing immediately. The pin over the g7-square is extremely annoying, but
Black has an active queen and material advantage.}) 25. Bh6 Rf7 26. Qg5 f4 27.

threats, isn't it? Black tries to create a superiority of kingside pieces and,
probably, an attack on this area of the board. White has a passed pawn on d6,
but this pawn is blockaded. White has the bishop pair, but his bishops don't
have active diagonals. On the other hand, Black's b7-bishop is a powerful
piece and it is coordinated with the queen on g5. The position is dynamically
equal, but Black has better prospects thanks to the tremendous activity of the
g5-queen and the b7-bishop.} (16... e5 $5) (16... Rc8 $5) (16... Qh4 $5) (16...

lot of ideas behind it. The queen is on the light squares; so, White cannot
win any tempo with threats like Be3. The queen is overprotecting the f7-pawn;
so, Black may consider playing Rae8 and e5. Black increases the control over
the e4-square; so, she might play Be4 and Rac8. I'd like to mention again that
this isn't the best move according to the computer, but it's very didactic to
