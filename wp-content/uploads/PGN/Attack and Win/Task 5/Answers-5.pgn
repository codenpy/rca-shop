Nc6 9. O-O-O d5 10. exd5 Nxd5 {Diagram #} 11. Nxc6 $1 {The Sicilian is a very
aggressive opening with sacrifices and brutal attacks, but not all the time.
Sometimes, you can play positionally and occupy strong outposts with your
pieces. After this exchange, White destroys Black's pawn structure and he will
fight for the c5 outpost.} (11. Nxd5 $5) (11. Bg1 $6 Nxc3 12. Qxc3 Qc7 $17) (
11. Bf2 Nxc3 12. Qxc3 Qb6 $36) 11... bxc6 12. Bd4 {In order to fight for the
c5-square, it's important to exchange the defender of this square, the
dark-squared bishop. White is performing this exchange in order to weaken the
dark squares and play positionally; he is not intending to attack the kingside.
Similarly, the g7-bishop is a very good attacking piece and White tries to
take out the sting out of the spear. Please also note that Black cannot
exchange on d4 and on c3. The d5-knight is pinned because the d8-queen isn't
protected very well and the c6 pawn is a weakness.} e5 13. Bc5 {White occupies
the weak square on c5, and he will transfer the knight there via the e4-square.
} Be6 14. Ne4 Rb8 15. Ba3 {White has a very good position here because he
controls the b2-square; the c5 is a nice outpost for the knight. Black cannot
find immediate counterplay on the b2-pawn. White manages to win the game
afterwards.} (15. Bc4 $5) (15. c4 $5 Nb6) (15. Bxf8 $2 Qxf8 $44) (15. b3 $5)

accepts the sacrifice, then White will create a powerful pawn center.} (28. Rd6
