previous move because Rb1 was hanging. However, after Ra1 Black was forced to
deal with this threat, g4. Thus, Tal decides to sacrifice his knight on f4 in

will continue putting presure on White's position.} (21... Nf6 $5) (21... Bd7

There is no obvious way to defend the c3-knight and break the pin on the
a1-rook; so, White should give even more material.} 24. Rab1 f3 $1 {Black has t
o play this move in any case in order to destroy White's coordination and
create an escaping square for his queen. Similalry, the h2-b8 diagonal is open
now, and Black may give a check on e5 at the appropriate moment.} (24... Bxb1
