Bc2 {Diagram #} Bxd4 $1 {White has a very aggressive position with a lot of
threats. The d3-bishop is very active and White manages to concentrate all of
his pieces on the kingside. In such situations, you need to exchange some of
the pieces in order to relieve the bind.} 22. Qh4 Nf8 {This is a double threat
on the h7-pawn and the e7-rook; however, Black has everything under control,
and he calmly plays knight to f8. With the last move, he protects the rook and
the vulnerable h7-square.} 23. Rxd4 Re2 $17 {Black has a fantastic knight on
f8, which stops all possible attacks. Black's rook is very active, and it
already creates problems on the c2-bishop and the b2-pawn. Black successfully
slows down White's attack, and now, it is his turn to start his counterplay on
the queenside or on the open e-line, which he controls. Please also note that
the d5-pawn is in the same color with the bishop, and this is a clear problem
for White because this pawn is limiting the bishop's activity. Black has a
clear advantage and he manages to win the game afterwards.} (23... Rce8 $5) 24.

This is a typical Sicilian sacrifice with knight to d5. White gives up his
central pawn in order to put his pieces actively there. On the other hand,
Black is trying to keep close the lines because his king is uncastled. In
order to open the position, White should invest a lot of material, a sacrifice
of the knight in this particular position. Black should base his defense in
his material advantage. The key maneuver is to run away the king to the
queenside.} 14. Nf5 Bf8 15. exd5 Qb6 {There are a lot of interesting options
here; however, Tal chooses an aggressive approach. I think that one of the
reasons to retrieve the queen is to advance the a-pawn. The other idea is to
overprotect the d6 vulnerable pawn.} (15... h6 $5) (15... Kd8 $5) 16. Rhe1+ Kd8

Qg3 $1 {Black's threat is obvious, to checkmate on g2. The best method to
defend in such position is to exchange the strongest attacking piece of your
opponent, I mean the black queen. White has material advantage -a clear pawn
up; so, if he manages to stop White's attack, then he can convert his extra
pawn into a win.} Qd2 21. Rac1 {Sometimes, when you are defending, you need to
make some simple moves, to protect your pieces. Black's queen looks very
active in White's position; however, White can kick it away soon with Qe3.} Rf6

{When you have opposite-side castles on the board, the position is very sharp.
In such cases, you need to open lines against the enemy king. We can see here
that Black can open lines faster, but it doesn't mean that he can guarantee
the victory. The main problem for Black is that the d7-knight and the d8-rook
are far away from the action. Of course, White should recapture the g4-pawn in
order to keep the g-line closed. Both captures on g4 are correct, but it's
safer with the f-pawn. After that, Black should sacrifice more material in
order to open the kingside totally.} Rdf8 21. Rf1 $1 {The situation is still
critical for White and, before starting his own activities on the queenside,
he should secure his king's position.} Nxg4 22. hxg4 Nf6 23. d5 $1 {Black doesn
't have any direct threat and, for that reason, White strikes in the center.
He opens lines for his f2-bishop. Now he threatens the a7-pawn. White has a
winning advantage, and he converts into a full point afterwards.} c5 24. bxc5
