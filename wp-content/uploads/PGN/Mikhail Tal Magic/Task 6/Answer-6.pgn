At this point, White has a lot of options, but Tal didn't manage to select the
best one. It's hard to understand why he chose a risky continuation when other
playable and more safer lines were available.} (6. Nf3 $1 {This is a continuati

so early in the game was incorrect; and this was the main reason to lose the
game later on.} 9. Qe2 Bb4+ 10. c3 Bd6 11. Bg2 Qh6 12. Bd4+ Kd8 13. Nf3 Bg4 14.

Black is in a difficult position and no one can disagree with that. In the
defense, we need to stay calm, examine carefully our opponent's attacking
ideas and wait for the right moment to counterattack. Black has some ideas and
the initiative on the kingside because his knights and queen are located there.
Unfortunately, Tal was in a hurry and he just sacrificed material. Here I'd
like to give you some general notes. If your position is bad, then probably
these kind of tactics, as Ng3+, is not going to work out. When the immediate
treats are not working, then you need to create a threat. Black would happily
play Qh4 and Ng3, but the problem is that the dark squared-bishop would
capture on e5 and it would control the g3-square. Therefore, Black should give
up the exchange on b4, for tactical reasons, in order to distract thec3-bishop.

easily.} 1-0

game. Black has a lot of interesting choices. First of all, he can conquer the
d3-square with the knight, a positional approach. Another idea is to play Qg6
in order to create the treat of Bxh3. If you sacrifice your pieces too early
in the game without a good development, there is a big risk that your attack
fails.} (15... Qg6 $1) (15... Nd3 $5) 16. gxh3 Nd3 17. f4 $1 {The position is
playable with opportunities for both sides, but it wasn't necessary to
sacrifice a piece on White's kingside. Black has no direct attack. So, the
conclusion is this: If you don't have a direct attack, then you should prefer
to increase the position of your pieces, and prepare your attack before the
sacrifice.} Nxf4 (17... O-O-O $5) 18. Rxf4 $5 {White can play the ambitious
Kh1, but the move in the game is also good. He exchanges one of Black's most
dangerous pieces and practically stops any of Black's attacking ideas.} (18.

can capture the knight, but the queen is 'trapped' on the enemy territory. The
best move here is to play Bd3, but this is an extremely difficult move to spot
during the game. The idea is to play e4 and open an escape square for the

Nxc6 $6 {To take is a mistake. This is a key rule which explains how important
the activity of the pieces is. As we mentioned in a previous game, it's
important not to start a very early attack. Your first priority in the opening
is to develop your pieces.} (7. Qd2) (7. Ndb5) 7... bxc6 8. e5 $6 Qa5 9. Bb5 {
White has to play such dubious moves because all of his developed pieces are
attacked or pinned. Tal started a very early attack and he will regret it very
soon.} cxb5 10. exf6 b4 {This is a double attack on the c3-knight and the
g5-bishop. Black's queen is super active and, for that reason, Black happily
forces the matters.} 11. Qf3 Qe5+ 12. Ne4 d5 $19 {As we learn in another task,
the pin attack is a powerful weapon. We can see it here, used against Tal.} 13.
