you need to calculate the killing blow, you need to calculate checks, captures

as we already know, it's important to keep the queens on the board when we
have an attack. However, the problem here is that this h3-bishop is pinned and
White can bring the knight to g1. When you calculate positions like those, you
should understand that White needs two tempos in order to perform his plan.
