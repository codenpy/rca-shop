a6 9. O-O-O {Diagram #} Qa5 $5 {In an opposite side castling, it's normal to
attack the enemy king. Black has plenty of ideas to do it here; however, Tal
chooses the most straightforward move, 9.Qa5. White cannot play Nd5
immediately because the queen can capture on d2 with check.} (9... b5 $5) (9...

This is a very risky idea which Tal has foreseen before playing Qa5. His idea
was to sacrifice his queen in order to create heavy problems in White's
position.} 11. Nd5 Nxd5 12. Qxa5 Nxe3 13. Rc1 Nxc4 $44 {The computer analysis
shows that White has a clear advantage here; however, in a practical game it's
very difficult to play because one doesn't have any active moves. Black can
develop his attack very naturally, and the g7-bishop is without its
counterpart. For that reason, White sacrifices the Exchange here.} 14. Rxc4 (

Now the b-line is open, and Tal manages to win a beautiful game afterwards.}

gxf6 9. Be2 a6 10. O-O Bb7 {Diagram #} 11. d5 $5 {The Botvinnik system in the
Semi-slav is one of the most exciting variations in the opening. White is
ready to sacrifice a lot of material in order to open the position and attack
his enemy king. This system has a lot of fun. Black's king is in the center of
the board, so White should find a way to open it. As we already mention in the
attack lesson, when you want to open the center, you need to advance your
pawns and exchange them with your opponent's counterparts.} (11. b3 $5 b4 12.
