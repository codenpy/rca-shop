1. Nc3 d5 2. e4 Nf6 {(a reasonable alternative to our main line 2...dxe4)} (
2... d4 $5 {Objectively this move is the best. However, White players are
usually well familiar with it. White's next moves are pretty simple in this
line. That's why I offered you other variations against 1.Nc3.} 3. Nce2 Nf6 4.

4... Nb6 5. Bb3 c5 6. d3 Bf5 {[Converted to modern scandivian where black is
perfectly OK]} 7. Qf3 Qd7 $11 {(black's plan is to play e6, Nc6 , Be7 etc....)}
) 3... d4 {converted to anti-alekhine line, where endgame appears after some
series of forcing exchanges.....} (3... Nfd7 $5 {If you are familiar with
French defense, then this move is well suit for you. Although in addition to
French defense you should be ready to face the move} 4. e6) 4. exf6 (4. Nce2 $5

further exchanges and continue the middlegame} Ng4 (4... Nfd7 $6 5. e6 $14 {
white successfully break the natural flow of black's development. ...}) 5. f4 (
5. Nf3 Nc6 6. h3 Ngxe5 7. Nexd4 Nxd4 8. Nxe5 Qd5 $15 {black is ahead in
development!}) 5... g6 6. Nf3 Nc6 7. b3 Bg7 8. Bb2 d3 $36 {followed by Nb4...
good active play for black!}) 4... dxc3 5. fxg7 (5. bxc3 $5 exf6 6. Nf3 Bd6 7.

little bit awkward position than black's one...}) 5... cxd2+ 6. Qxd2 (6. Bxd2

possibilities to play on and outplay your opponent.} *
