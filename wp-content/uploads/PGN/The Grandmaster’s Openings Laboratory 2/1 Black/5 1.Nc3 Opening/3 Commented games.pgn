1. e4 d5 2. Nc3 {Now it transposes into the 1.Nc3 opening...} dxe4 3. Nxe4 Bf5
{Developing move with attack...} 4. Ng3 Bg6 {This bishop eliminates White's
play along the b1-h7 diagonal.} 5. Nf3 Nc6 {Black delays king side development;
his plan is 0-0-0, followed by h5-h4 and thereby launching an attack along the
king side!!} 6. Bb5 (6. h4 h6 {With level play, see theory section.}) 6... Qd6
$5 {Defending the c6 knight, e5 square and preparing 0-0-0...} 7. O-O O-O-O 8.
d3 {White can't play d4 here...} h5 $5 {Little bit optimistic before
developing minor pieces... but practically playable.} (8... e6 $5 {Sensible.}
9. Qe2 Nf6 10. Be3 a6 11. Ba4 Be7 {And Black successfully completes his
development and is thereby ready for attacking White's king.}) 9. Bxc6 Qxc6 {
Black is happy with the exchange...} 10. Ne5 Qf6 {Preparing e6, Bd6 and Ne7,
etc.} 11. Nxg6 Qxg6 12. Qf3 Nf6 13. h3 h4 14. Qf5+ {After this queen exchange,
there is no logical chance to win the game for either side; but the player
with more positional understanding and better knowledge in the endgame is
always preferred in this kind of equal position.} (14. Ne4 $5 e6 15. Be3 (15.
Nxf6 $6 gxf6 $40) 15... a6 16. Rad1 Rh5 $36) 14... Qxf5 15. Nxf5 e6 {Open up
lines for the bishop with tempo... again forcing the knight to go back to an
odd square - 'e3' - thus blocking its own bishop.} 16. Ne3 Rh5 {The rook comes
out to enjoy maximum activity.} 17. Ng4 $2 {The main drawback to this
advancing knight move is that the 'c2' pawn is now undefended... in fact, it's
very easy to miss, as rooks rarely come to the 'c' file to attack the 'c2'
pawn in general.} (17. Bd2 $5 Ne4 18. Be1 $11) 17... Nxg4 $1 18. hxg4 Rc5 $1 {
This is the result of the previous unusual Rh5 move by Black.} 19. c4 Rxd3 {
White gets no compensation for his lost pawn.} 20. b3 Re5 {Black improves his
piece position move by move.} 21. Be3 Bc5 {Elimination of White's strongest
piece is a good decision by Black.} 22. Bxc5 Rxc5 23. Rad1 Rxd1 24. Rxd1 Rc6
25. Rd3 Rd6 $17 {And the rest is a matter of technique... Black has a wining
position already.} 26. Rf3 f6 27. Kh2 Rd1 28. g5 {White desperately tries for
counterplay... but with accurate play, Black must surely win.} fxg5 29. Rf8+
Kd7 30. Rf7+ Kd6 31. Rxg7 Rd2 {Rook should be engaged in active play rather in
defence.} 32. f3 Rxa2 33. Rxg5 Rb2 34. Rb5 b6 35. Kh3 c5 36. b4 Rxb4 0-1

1. Nc3 {This is one of the weapons of those players who like to surprise their
opponents by having deep opening preparation.} d5 {Main intention of this move
is to provoke White into playing 2.d4, after which White will have to play a
strategically incorrect opening.} 2. e4 {for} (2. d4 {See theory section.})

O-O-O {After a series of quiet moves, both players complete the normal
development.} c6 11. Kb1 Re8 12. Rhe1 b5 $17 {Black is better in this position,
as his pawn storm along the queen side is much quicker than White's on the
king side.} 13. Bb3 a5 {Black doesn't give White any time to implement his own
plan, i.e. attack on the king side.} 14. a3 Nc5 {Black's every move is an
attacking one...} 15. Ba2 b4 {We should open up lines when we continue an
attack, to give it a successful shape!} 16. Ne5 bxa3 17. Nxg6 hxg6 18. b3 {
White tries desperately to block the queen side to prevent a further attack on
his king... but his position is already damaged.} Qd4 $6 {A little slip in a
winning position.} (18... Rb8 $1 {Is a killer...} 19. d4 (19. Ne4 a4 20. Nxc5

Bf6!, a nice domination in the centre with all the active pieces.} 21. d4 Nd7

occupies a key outpost, thus paralysing White's king forever.} 27. Ka1 Ra7 28.
Bb1 Rd8 29. Red1 Rad7 {The presence of the weak 'd4' pawn in the semi-open
d-file makes Black's play a little easier.} 30. Be4 f5 31. Bf3 Kg7 32. h3 e5

the previous game, where White castled queen side.} Be7 11. a4 O-O 12. Rfb1 $6
