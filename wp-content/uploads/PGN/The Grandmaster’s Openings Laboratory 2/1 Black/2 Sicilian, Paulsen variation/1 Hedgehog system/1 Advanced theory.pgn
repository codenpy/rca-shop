1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 a6 5. Bd3 Nf6 6. O-O {If someone plays 5.
Bd3, then his main idea is to play Qe2 and c4, and hence he will not develop
the knight to c3.} Qc7 7. Qe2 {White now threatens to push in the centre with
e5.} (7. c4 {Is analysed in the game Wolff-Gheorghiu.}) 7... d6 8. c4 (8. f4 g6
9. f5 Bg7 10. fxe6 fxe6 11. Nc3 Nc6 12. Nxc6 Qxc6 $1 {And Black is all right.}
(12... bxc6 $2 13. e5 dxe5 14. Ne4 O-O 15. Be3 {White has a small edge here.}))
8... g6 $1 {Developing the bishop more actively makes complete sense, as first
of all in the Maroczy Black often plays Be7 and 0-0 and then later Re8 Bf8 g6
Bg7. So here why not develop the bishop on g7 when we have the chance? Also
the d4 knight looks a little unsupported, and because of so many pieces on the
'd' file, the d6 pawn is not at all weak. All in all, a strong case for the
development of the bishop on g7.} 9. Nc3 Bg7 {This is the modern-day Tabiya.
And we must make a good effort to understand this position as clearly as we
can. More than moves, it's the ideas that are important. First of all, we must
understand that there are two ways for White to play: 1. the classical way,
which is to play Be3 f3 Rfd1 Rac1 and followed it with b4; 2. the 2nd way is
to play as the top players normally do, that is, to play the moves Nf3,Rd1 or
Bf4 in any order.} 10. Be3 {This is the most natural way to play and, unless
you are facing a well- prepared opponent, you can expect players to play just
naturally like this.} (10. Nf3 O-O 11. Bf4 Nh5 12. Be3 Bxc3 13. bxc3 {Is seen
in the game Grischuk-Ivanchuk.}) (10. Rd1 O-O 11. Nf3 Nc6 12. h3 Nd7 13. Be3
Bxc3 14. bxc3 {Is seen in the game Leko-Ivanchuk.}) (10. Nf3 O-O 11. Bf4 Nh5
12. Bg5 Bxc3 13. bxc3 {Is analysed in Shirov-Ivanchuk.}) (10. Nf3 O-O 11. Rd1
Nc6 12. h3 Nd7 13. Bf4 Bxc3 14. bxc3 {Is seen in Karjakin-Ivanchuk. The
difference between this position and the one with Leko is that here the bishop
is on f4 and there it was on e3.}) (10. Rd1 O-O 11. Nf3 Nc6 12. Bf4 e5 13. Be3
Bg4 {Is analysed in the game Svidler-Ivanchuk.}) 10... O-O 11. Rac1 Nbd7 12.
Rfd1 b6 13. f3 Bb7 14. Qf2 Rac8 15. Bf1 Qb8 16. b4 Rfe8 17. Nb3 {This final
position, as well as the previous moves, is well analysed in the game
Uribe-Zapata.} *
