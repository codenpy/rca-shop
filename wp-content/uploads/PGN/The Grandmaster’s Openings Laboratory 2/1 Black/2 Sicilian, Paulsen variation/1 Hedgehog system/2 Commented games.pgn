important move: bc6 will be preferred when we actually can play d5 in the

take with the 'd' pawn. This helps us to speed up our development with e5, and
our c8 bishop develops easily.} 9. f4 {Looks logical in order to play e5.} e5

sacrifice his bishop on g7 for the knight on c3. I call it a sacrifice because
it is such an important bishop that we are giving up. But then why are we
giving it up? It's for the sole reason that we can have clarity of play
afterwards. We can put our pawns on dark square and play against White's weak
pawns.} (12. Bd2 {Is much more conservative, as now we cannot ruin White's

dark squares like e5 and f6 and then attacking the c4 pawn. All in all, thanks
to this Bc3 idea, the game takes on a very concrete character; and if you are

complex enough to give him chances. Hence he doesn't deem it necessary to make
an uncomfortable move like Bd2.} Bxc3 $1 {As always, Ivanchuk stays true to
this idea in the Paulsen.} 14. bxc3 {What now follows is what we must learn
from Ivanchuk: how to play after the bishop is given up. The ideal setup as we
know is e5-f6-Be6-Nc5-Qf7 - maybe followed by Na5 with excellent pressure on
the c4 pawn. Ivanchuk first starts with f6, but he could have just as well

that the risky idea of Bc3 was going to be tried against someone who was ready

{After analysing five games by Vasily Ivanchuk, we have good ideas up our
sleeve as to what to do when our opponent plays Nf3 followed by h3 and Bf4 or
Rd1 followed by Nf3 and Bf4 and similar ideas. But what we don't know is what
to do if White plays naturally. i.e. if White is not interested in subtleties
and just plays Be3 Rac1 Rfd1 and goes into normal hedgehog play. Here we will

development ahead of the normal 0-0. The point is that with the bishop on d3,
it makes sense to play Ne5 as quickly as possible. So we make that move even
before 0-0.} 11. Rac1 (11. f4 $5 {This move stops Ne5 but weakens the e4 pawn;
and later we can make the very thematic e5 move, securing that square for our
pieces.} O-O 12. Rac1 e5 $1 13. Nf3 exf4 14. Bxf4 Nc5 {After this, Black will

it's not easy for White to follow the standard plan of f3, Rfd1,Qf2 ,b4,Nb3 -
as happened in the main game. The knight on e5 keeps putting unpleasant
pressure on White's position.} 12. f3 {This looks like the most natural move,
stopping Ng4.} (12. b3 Nfg4 $1 13. Bf4 Nxd3 14. Qxd3 e5 15. Nd5 Qb8 $15 {White

pawn or White will have sacrificed the exchange.}) 11. Rac1 {'The white rooks
go to their natural squares - c1 and d1. White will then play f3, Qf2 and Bf1,
and then try to expand on the queen side. What is Black to do at that time?
Black also has a set way of developing: Nbd7, b6, Bb7, Rac8, Rfe8, Qb8 and
then respond to what White does. Usually the middlegames in the Hedgehog are
dictated by lots of slow manoeuvring and moving from here to there. But if
Black gets the break of d5 or b5 in time, then the position becomes very
interesting and the need for accurate calculation is very high on the agenda.
Hence you need to have a unique blend of patience and accurate timing in order
to play the Hedgehog well.} (11. f4 $5 {Once I faced this aggressive move when
playing on the internet. White's idea is maybe at some point to play f5 and
blow away Black's position.} Nbd7 $1 {Is the accurate way to continue. Now f5
is no longer possible, as the knight on e5 will sit strong.} (11... b6 $6 {Is
the wrong way to start, as then White can continue his push forward with...}

accurately the consequences of a knight fork on d6.} (15... Rfe8 16. Ndb5 $5

initiative and it makes sense to avoid such lines if we can. All we have to do
is to play Qb8 before Rfe8.}) 16. b4 $1 {Snatching space on the queen side.
Sooner or later, White will have to do this.} (16. b3 {The more restrained
approach doesn't make much sense, as later White will have to play b4 anyway,
when he will have lost a tempo. Black can continue as in the game with Rfe8.})
16... Rfe8 $1 {'Sometimes such moves confuse us. But they often show us that
chess is deep. This is some kind of a mysterious rook move, as Nimzowitsch
liked to call it. But the idea is very clear. Black would like to prepare the
d5 breakthrough. When White takes, Black will take back and the rook on e8
will come to life, aiming at the bishop on e3 with lot of potential exchange
sacrifices in the offing. Hence this is the best place for the rook in
Hedgehog structures.} 17. Nb3 {Attacks the b6 pawn and prepares a4-a5. But
Black has set his eyes upon the d5 plan and now sees that this is the most
opportune moment to play it.} d5 {The spiny creature fights back! All the
pent-up energy in Black's position is released and White has to be really
careful, as one mistake and he can land himself in an inferior position.} (
