Usually sicilian is an opening which is played on dark squares, thus giving up
the dark squared bishop is a huge investment by white. In return he gets a few
things. First of all he spoils the opponents pawn structure and secondly the
black king is left with no safe home!} gxf6 11. Qg4 {After runining blacks
pawn structure, black usually makes this move. His idea is to penetrate into
g7 with the queen! Of course we prevent it now!} Kf8 $1 {Though the king
cannot castle here, the central pawns give it good shelter. On the other hand,
he has the g file for his rook. Combined with b5-Bb7, the rook and bishop will
hit on g2. The bishop on c5 already strikes on f2. Thus it can lead to an
interesting kingside attack.} (11... Qe5 12. Qg7 Rf8 13. Kh1 Qg5 {is another

{Of course the right home for the bishop c8 is on b7 as it will put latent
pressure on the g2 square. The standard position of this variation. White
accepted to play against blacks double bishops for 2 reasons: 1.Blacks pawn
structure is weakened. 2.his king is in the center and development yet to be
completed. So what is black playing for? Black may have 3 pawn islands but he
can foresee a potential weakness on the 2 open files which he is having: g2 on
g-file and a8-h1 diagonal. and c2 on c-file which is always a potential
weakness in sicilian. Blacks central pawn structure is in fact safeguarding
his king. ofcourse he must be careful abt the tactical possibilities having
his king in the center. Mainly black will try to activate his Bishops and make
them powerful and his pressurize whites king through g file. and if queens
will be exchanged anytime, then whites QS pawn structure will be pressurized.
