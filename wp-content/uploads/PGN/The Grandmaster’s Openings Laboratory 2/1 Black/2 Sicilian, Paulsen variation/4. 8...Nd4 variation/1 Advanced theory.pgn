1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 a6 5. Nc3 Qc7 6. Bd3 Nc6 {There are two
main moves in this position. One is Nc6 and the other is what we are going to
analyse here, that is Be3.} 7. Be3 Nf6 8. O-O {This is a very important
position for any player playing the Paulsen Defence. Nearly 4,200 games have
been played in this variation. Bd6 has been recommended in the first course.
However, here we provide you with an alternative line which is extremely solid.
} Nxd4 9. Bxd4 Bc5 {With this move, Black intends to exchange two pairs of
minor pieces, which will severely impair White's attacking potential. At the
same time, after the dark-squared bishops exchange, Black intends to place his
pawns on dark squares - on d6 and e5 - in such a way that White's e4 pawn
becomes fixed. In this way, the d3 bishop is also impeded. Thus you can judge
for yourself that this is an extremely solid line for Black. There are three
main moves in this position. The overwhelmingly popular move here is to
exchange the bishop with Bc5, and the other two less played moves are Bf6 and
Be2.} 10. Bxc5 (10. Be2 {Is a very tricky line. The main intention of White is
to build pressure down the 'b' file. Hence Black must be careful.} e5 $1 {
Forcing matters...} 11. Bxc5 Qxc5 12. Qd3 {With the idea of doubling up along
the 'd' file and also, at some point, of exchanging with Qc4.} b6 $1 $146 {
Everyone had previously played b5 when White was making use of ideas like a4
or b4 followed by a4, to take advantage of Black lagging behind in development.
In this novel case of b6! we experience no such problems and can equalise with
ease. The analysis of this move is seen in the game Navara-Movsesian.}) (10.
Bxf6 {Is a very risky decision for both sides. White gives up his dark-squared
bishop and leaves Black with the bishop pair. But in return White's pawn
structure is spoilt and he doesn't really know where to park his king. All in
all, this variation leads to very exciting games.} gxf6 11. Qg4 Kf8 12. Kh1 h5
13. Qh4 Be7 14. f4 b5 15. f5 Qe5 {This highly imbalanced variation will be
analysed in the spectacular game, Fedorov-Miezis.}) 10... Qxc5 {Here White has
four different possibilities (in their order of popularity): 1.Kh1 with the
idea of f4; 2.Qe2, just connecting the rooks; 3. Na4, trying to set up a
Maroczy Bind with c4; 4.Qd2, trying to put pressure down the 'd' file.} 11. Kh1
(11. Qe2 d6 12. Kh1 e5 {The normal reaction in this position. But we must be
careful as, instead of Qe1, the queen is on e2; this apparently minor detail
makes a huge difference, as we shall see.} 13. f4 O-O 14. Nd5 $1 {This is the
only dangerous move for Black, but never really played.} (14. f5 b5 15. g4 Bb7
{Is favourable for Black.}) 14... Nxd5 15. exd5 Re8 $1 {This cool move is
analysed in the game Ahmed-Ismagembetov.} (15... Qxd5 16. f5 $1 {In the Qe1
line, we used to play f6. But here it is impossible because Bc4 will win the
queen. This is the key difference in the position.})) (11. Na4 Qc7 12. c4 {In
this position, it's more than theory - you must be well versed in plans.} d6
13. Qe2 O-O 14. Rac1 Bd7 {We see analysis around this position in our
illustrative game Wagener-Mamedyarov.}) (11. Qd2 {Though this move is
relatively less played, it is none the less quite potent - White's main idea
is to pressurise Black's king side with Rae1-e3-g3.} O-O 12. Rae1 d6 13. Re3 {
The analysis of this position shall be dealt with in the game Bargan-Zhadko.} (
13. Kh1 {Is also considered in the illustrative game.}) 13... Bd7 $1 $146 {Is
the new move that we propose in this position.}) 11... d6 12. f4 {This is the
most logical way to play. The idea can be to open further lines with the help
of e5.} e5 $1 {Preventing the move e5, at the same time rendering the bishop
on d3 a rather ineffective piece and placing the pawns on the opposite colour
to our bishop. e5 is indeed an excellent move.} 13. Qe1 {Now the idea is to
play Qh4. But White has many other possibilities at move 13. They are - f5,
fe5, Nd5 and Qd2. They are all analysed in the game Balashov-Tregubov.} O-O 14.
Qh4 {And here we recommend a new move which seems a little artificial but
which is very logical...} h6 $1 $146 *
