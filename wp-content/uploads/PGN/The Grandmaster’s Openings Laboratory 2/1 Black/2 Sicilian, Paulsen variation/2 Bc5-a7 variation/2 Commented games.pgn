flexible move - retaining the option of Nc6 or Nf6 or Ne7 as per White's

White has lost the opportunity to play c4 and enter into a Maroczy Bind set-up.
Hence 8. Be3 is a much more flexible option.} (8. Be3 Nc6 9. Nc3 b5 {Merely
transposes...}) 8... Nc6 9. Be3 {White usually exchanges the strong bishop on
a7.} b5 $5 {Black gains space on the queen side with this move. At the same

excellent mobility on the second rank.} (9... Nge7 $5 {Would have kept options

Clamping down on the dark squares.} 11. Nc3 O-O 12. Rad1 {This is a very
logical move, putting the rook on the semi-open file and intending to put
pressure on the backward d6 pawn.} Be6 {A very nice, coherent developing move.}
13. Nd5 {If you ask one question here - what was the drawback to my opponent's
last move - then you will come to the conclusion that the knight no longer
controls the b5 square. Hence we try further to increase control over the dark
squares. But how do we do it? One way of increasing our control is to remove
the opponent's pieces that are controlling the dark squares. In this instance,
the knight on b3 is controlling the d4 and c5 squares, and hence Black
continues a5 with the idea of pushing the b3 knight away.} a5 $1 14. Bxa7 (14.
c5 {Can be a logical move, to push and prevent Black from taking over the dark
squares.} a4 15. cxd6 Qxd6 {Black has a comfortable position. White has to
resort to tactical means to keep the balance in this position.} 16. Bc4 {

) 18... f6 $1 {Very solid play by Black, who has an excellent position. One
very important reason for this is that, of the two bishops remaining on the
board, the White bishop is the worse piece.} 19. f5 Nxd5 $1 20. cxd5 Bd7 21. g4

saying that he doesn't want to play a strategic battle and would rather settle
the game based on tactical motifs.} (14. a4 {Shirov was so worried about the

{This game is quite a mismatch, as the player with the White pieces isn't such
a strong player while the player with Black is an extremely strong GM. Still,
such games help us to understand better the motifs in a position like this.} 1.

is doing a wonderful job, so is the knight on c6. We can't expect much from
the bishop on e6, but it is doing its job of attacking the d5 knight. The only
piece that is underperforming is the knight on e7. This knight can be
relocated from e7 to c5 but how? Yes - Ng6-f8-d7-c5! Konstantin does know
where his pieces belong!} Ng6 15. g3 {Preventing Nf4 just in case.} Re8 $5 {
