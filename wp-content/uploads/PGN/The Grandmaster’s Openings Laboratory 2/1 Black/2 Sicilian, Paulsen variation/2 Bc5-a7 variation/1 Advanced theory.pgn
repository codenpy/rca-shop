1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 a6 5. Bd3 Bc5 $5 {In conjunction with
our solid repertoire beginning with 5...Nf6, this line with 5...Bc5 is
extremely interesting. Black makes use of his move a6, to find a highly
unusual home for the dark-squared bishop - on a7. With the bishop there, the
contours of the battle become completely different. The Black bishop will be
extremely well placed, cutting across, the board; but at the same time, its
absence will be felt from the king side. Black's dark squares, and especially
the g7 point, can become extremely weak. Thus this line, with the unusual
development of the bishop, is a highly dynamic and unbalanced one.} 6. Nb3 {
This is played almost 90% of the time. However, one very important alternative
is the move Be3.} (6. Be3 d6 $1 {This seems to me like a natural way to play,
staying within the bounds of our repertoire.} (6... Qb6 {Is the move that
tries to punish White for playing Be3. But I am not sure whether it is that
strong.} 7. c3 $1 {Daring Black to take on b2. Because if he doesn't, then the
move of Qb6 is useless.} Qxb2 (7... Nc6 8. Nd2 Nxd4 9. Nc4 $16) 8. O-O $1 {
Gaining a lead in development.} Qxa1 {Black takes a rook and asks how White
will trap the queen? Of course, he will move the queen and then the knight and
trap the Black queen. But Black will gain two rooks for the queen, which will
be a good deal. The only problem is Black's lack of development.} 9. Qc2 {
Threatens Nb3.} Bxd4 10. cxd4 {(attacking the c8-bishop)} Ne7 11. Nc3 Qxf1+ 12.
Bxf1 O-O 13. d5 $16 {Black is materially fine but really very passive - hence
this seems like an advantage to White.}) 7. O-O Ne7 {As always, we prefer to
develop the knight on this square.} 8. Nc3 O-O 9. Qe2 (9. e5 Bxd4 (9... dxe5
10. Nxe6 $14) 10. Bxd4 Nec6 11. Bxh7+ Kxh7 12. Qh5+ Kg8 13. Ne4 {(threatening
Ng5)} Nxd4 14. Ng5 Qxg5 15. Qxg5 dxe5 16. Qxe5 Nxc2 17. Rad1 $11) 9... Qc7 10.
Rad1 Nbc6 11. Nxc6 Qxc6 $11 {Gives Black a playable position.}) 6... Ba7 7. Qe2
{The most natural move for White. The idea is to play the bishop to e3,
thereby neutralising the bishop on a7. It is also the most natural square for
the White queen, thereby paving the way for 0-0-0.} (7. Qg4 {Is the most
natural move. The bishop has moved away from the king side and hence Black
must be aware of the dangers that await him. Still, if you are well versed in
theory, then this move should not hurt you too much.} Nf6 $1 {Black doesn't
fear White taking the g7 pawn.} 8. Qg3 (8. Qxg7 $2 Rg8 9. Qh6 Bxf2+ $1 10. Kf1
(10. Kxf2 Ng4+) 10... Nc6 11. Bg5 Rg6 $17 {Black is clearly better.}) 8... d6
9. Nc3 Nc6 {This is the main position of the Qg4 line. There are primarily two
moves for White here. One is to play Bg5 followed by 0-0-0 - which will be
analysed in Zawadzka-Paehtz. And the other move is simply 0-0 - which will be
analysed in Berg-Hillarp Persson.}) (7. O-O Ne7 $1 8. Nc3 (8. c4 Nbc6 9. Nc3 d6
10. Qe2 e5 11. Be3 O-O {Transposes to the 7.Qe2 lines.}) 8... Nbc6 {If you
look at this position with fresh eyes, then the most logical move for White is
Qe2. In that case, the lines will be transposing to those of 7.Qe2. So I think
in this position the only independent plan for White is to play Kh1 followed
by f4.} 9. Kh1 (9. Qe2 d6 10. Be3 e5 {Transposes to the 7.Qe2 lines.}) 9... O-O
10. f4 {Now Black must counterattack in the centre with d5! This position will
be analysed in the game Zupancic-Neverov.} d5) (7. Nc3 Nc6 8. Qe2 {Will lead
to the 7.Qe2 lines.} (8. O-O {Will lead to the 7.0-0 lines.})) (7. c4 Nc6 8.
Nc3 d6 9. O-O Nge7 10. Kh1 (10. Qe2 O-O 11. Be3 e5 {Leads to lines analysed in
7.Qe2.}) 10... e5 11. f4 {Is analysed in the game Kalinina-Ciuksyte.}) 7... d6
{With this flexible move, we keep our options open. Sometimes we would like to
develop the knight on c6 or sometimes on f6 or sometimes Ne7. So d6 keeps all
possibilities alive.} 8. Be3 Nc6 9. O-O {By castling, White retains the option
of playing c4 later and entering into Maroczy territory.} (9. Nc3 Nge7 {Is the
key position of this variation, which is analysed.} (9... b5 {Leads to very
interesting play which is analysed in Kritz-Rublevsky. The funny thing is that
here White should now 0-0, as Black has already played b5; but Kritz later
played 0-0-0 and was under pressure due to Black's queen side play.}) 10. O-O (
10. O-O-O b5 $1 {Is analysed in Garcia-Korneev.}) 10... e5 {Is analysed in
Kotronias-Milov.}) 9... Nge7 10. c4 {White sets up the Maroczy position.
However, Black has now turned his attention to the fact that the dark squares
in White's position are extremely weak, and he therefore focuses on
dark-squared play beginning with...} e5 $1 11. Nc3 O-O {This is quite a
critical position and we shall examine four games from it in the illustrated
games section (Erwich-Shillong, Thipsay-Prathamesh, Sandipan-Kobalia and
Jonker-Landa). Once you have gone through the games, you will get a better
understanding of how to play this position. One thing is very clear here -
that Black is trying to play on the dark squares.} *
