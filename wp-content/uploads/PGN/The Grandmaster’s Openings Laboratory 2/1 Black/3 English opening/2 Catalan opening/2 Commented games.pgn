now, as in the game, e3 is not possible - as after Nf3 Bf3 the

c3 and hence it isn't threatening to move as yet. Black can therefore
play simple moves to develop his queen side bishop first.} (10.Qc1 Nxc3)

position a very coherent character.} 11.Ba1 {because of wasting
time with this, you can agree that instead of 10. Rc1, 10.Qc1
would have been a preferable choice} Nxc3 12.Bxc3 Ba6 {According
to me, Black is already better. He has quite a harmonious development
and White has not been able to demonstrate any advantage out
of the opening.} 13.d3 Rc8 $1 {Again, strong development and protecting
the knight puts the ball back in White's court as to what is
he going to do.} 14.Qd2 Qe7 (14...Bxc3 15.Qxc3 f6 16.Qb2 Bb7 17.Rfe1 Qd7 $15

a good idea to place the rook opposite the opponent's queen.

play Rc8 after b3, so that we don't really have to face the rather
irritating move Qa4. But, of course, in that case too we could
always defend with a6. Black usually has a set plan in this setup:
1. to play Rc8; 2. to play Bd6; 3. bring the queen to e7; 4.
bring the knight back to f6; 5. plonk the knight on e4; 6. and

this exchange, the scope of the b2 bishop is permanently reduced,

to be the only logical move.} (13.Bf4 Nh5 14.Bd2 Nhf6 15.Bf4 {You
may argue that White can go for a threefold repetition in this
