1. Nf3 (1. c4 Nf6 2. Nf3 (2. g3 {Is a tricky move order where our a6 idea will
not work.} e6 3. Bg2 d5 {Will lead to the main lines of Catalan opening}) 2...
e6 3. g3 a6 $5 {Will also lead to the same position.}) 1... Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. g3

(3. d4 Bb4+ {Leads to the Bogo-Indian, which we have also covered.}) 3... a6 $5
{What is this move? Are we only playing one that is suitable for blitz games?
Well, it is odd because we normally don't make pawn moves on the side of the
board in the opening. But this idea of Oleg Romanishin must not be taken
lightly. It has a very sound positional basis, i.e. to exchange the central
'c' pawn for the flank 'b' pawn, which would give Black more central control.
And if this explanation is not sufficient for you to believe in the merits of
this move, then here are some statistics. There are 1131 games in my database
currently for this line and the likes of Karpov, Ivanchuk, Mamedyarov, Kamsky,
Svidler, etc., have played it. What more proof does one want, that this is a
good move?!! As this was first played by Romanishin, we can label it as the
Romanishin line.} 4. Bg2 (4. Nc3 {This move tries to stop our natural idea
connected with b5. But one thing must be noted: the moves g3 and Nc3 don't
usually go well together and hence here Black must strike in the centre with...
} d5 5. cxd5 exd5 6. d4 Be7 7. Bg2 O-O 8. O-O c6 $11 {And Black has a nice
version of QGD Exchange Variation, because White's light-squared bishop here
belongs to d3 and not on g2 where it is attacking the solid black pawns on
b7-c6-d5.}) 4... b5 $1 {We play with total disregard for the power of the g2
bishop. White doesn't really have any good discovered attack for the bishop on
g2. And Black has achieved his goal of striking White's centre with the flank
'b' pawn.} 5. b3 {This is by far the main move, with 80% of games reaching
this position continued with the move b3. White says to Black that I respect
your strategy and see no way to take direct advantage of it. But I will
strengthen my 'c' pawn and will not let you exchange your flank pawn for my
central one. Thus b3 is a safe and solid move, but nothing that should worry
Black.} (5. Nd4 $5 {This is the most direct move and also a very dangerous one.
White threatens to win a pawn. Anyone who faces this variation for the first
time as White should logically go for this move because it is the most direct.
But not everyone has the courage to do so, because the resulting positions are
very complicated; and if Black has initiated this line, then White figures out
he must be better prepared.} c6 (5... d5 {This was the move that was made by
the founder of this system, Oleg Romanishin, when he faced this move Nd4.} 6.
cxb5 axb5 7. Nxb5 c6 8. N5c3 {And though Black has decent compensation, White
keeps a small edge. You can try this line if you find the 5..c6 line to be too
sharp for your liking.}) 6. cxb5 axb5 7. Nxb5 $1 {Of course, this must be
played. Otherwise Black would just play d5 and gain a wonderful position.} cxb5
$1 {Black rises to the challenge. First, he sacrifices a pawn and now an
exchange. But the bishop that will take on a8 sees the door slam shut right in
its face with...} 8. Bxa8 d5 $1 {The bishop on a8 has no way out. Now the
threat is Qa5, winning the a8 bishop. Once Black does that, he will go from
being materially behind to being materially ahead, with two pieces for a rook.}
9. Qc2 {This is by far the most logical move in this position: the Black queen
is not able to move freely as c8 bishop will be hanging and, at the same time,
Bc6+ is threatened. Hence Black's reply is forced - Bd7.} (9. b4 {This is
quite a critical move, as it stops Qa5 and also prepares quick development
with Bb2 when Ra1 will be defended and a4 becomes possible. So in response,
Black needs a decisive response, as the normal moves lead to an edge for White.
} Bxb4 $1 (9... Qc7 {Normal play like this guarantees White an edge after...}
10. Bb2 Qa7 (10... Be7 11. a4 $18 {As now the Ra1 is defended and there will
be no pins down the 'a' file.}) 11. Qc2 Bd7 12. Bxf6 gxf6 13. Bxd5 exd5 14. Nc3
$14 {And White is better.}) 10. Qb3 Qa5 11. a4 Bd7 {Now White has to find the
only move that gives him a decent position and that is...} 12. Ba3 $1 Bxa3 13.
axb5 $1 (13. Rxa3 b4 $17) (13. Nxa3 b4 $17) (13. Qxa3 b4 $19) 13... Qxa8 14.
Qxa3 Qxa3 15. Nxa3 {And this is the position. Though Black has a good material
situation, yet the 'b' pawn is strong - hence this position is equal. Play can
continue with...} Ke7 16. d3 Kd6 17. Kd2 Kc7 18. Rhc1+ Kb6 $11 {And with the
pawn firmly blockaded, Black can think about winning it with Ne8-d6 - Black is
fine.}) (9. Qb3 Bd7 10. O-O Na6 $15 {Next Black will pick up the a8 bishop, as
Bb7 is met with Nc5.}) (9. a4 Qa5 10. Nc3 (10. Qc2 Bd7 {Transposes to the main
line with 9.Qc2 and 10.a4.}) 10... Be7 $1 {Quickly finishing off the
development.} 11. Nxb5 O-O {The a8 bishop is lost now.} 12. Bxd5 exd5 $44 {
Though White has three pawns and a rook for two pieces, I think Black is
slightly better as the White pawns are threatening yet Black is ahead in
development.. At the same time, where to place the White king is quite a big
question, because if it castles, then the light-square weaknesses will start
to tell.}) 9... Bd7 {After this move I request you to go carefully through the
analysis of each of White's attempts to free his bishop, because it will not
only help you to get new ideas in this position but will also teach you the
art of analysis.} 10. Bb7 (10. a4 Qa5 {The only move - pinning the 'a' pawn
and attacking the bishop.} 11. Bb7 Bb4 $1 $146 {This new move is the best in
the position.} (11... b4 {Previously, only this had been played - which is
also not a bad move.}) 12. Nc3 (12. Bc8 Bc6 13. axb5 Qxb5 (13... Qxa1 14. bxc6
$18) 14. Nc3 Qb6 15. Na4 Qa5 16. O-O d4 17. d3 O-O 18. Bxe6 fxe6 $15 {Black
has excellent minor pieces, though the position is still quite complicated.})

intends to develop quickly with Bb2} Qb6 11. Bb2 Na6 $1 (11... Be7 $6 12. a4 $1
bxa4 13. Nc3 Qa7 14. Rxa4 Bxa4 15. Qxa4+ Qxa4 16. Nxa4 Bxb4 17. e3 $14 {With

the edge here due to his better minor pieces.}) (10. e4 Na6 $1 {The a8 bishop
is now hanging.} (10... Nxe4 {Was also possible.} 11. O-O Qa5 12. d3 Nd6 13.
Bxd5 exd5 $15 {When Black should be better, too.}) 11. Bc6 {White must do
something about his a8 bishop, so he saves it.} (11. exd5 Qxa8 $19) 11... Nb4

advantage.} 13. Qc3 (13. Qb3 Nc5 $19) 13... d4 $1 14. Qb3 Nc5 15. Qd1 Nbd3+ 16.
Kf1 Nxe4 $17 {White is totally busted: look at the Black knights.}) (10. b3 {
This move is not very challenging, as it allows Black to attack the bishop
with comfort.} Qa5 11. Bb7 Be7 12. Bb2 Qb6 13. Bc8 Bc6 {As usual, Bc8 is met
with Bc6 and the c8 bishop will be picked up after 0-0.}) 10... Qb6 11. Bc8 Bc6
12. a4 bxa4 13. Nc3 d4 14. Nxa4 Qd8 $15 {When Black will simply recover his
piece and will have the advantage.}) (5. d3 Bb7 {Followed by c5 Be7 0-0 - and
should give Black a good position.}) (5. O-O bxc4 6. Qa4 Bb7 7. Qxc4 d5 8. Qa4+
Nbd7 9. d4 Bd6 10. Ne5 O-O 11. Nc6 Qe8 $11 {Merely serves to give Black a fine
position.}) (5. Ne5 c6 (5... d5 6. cxd5 exd5 7. d4 {Leads to a position which
is better for White, as the c5 square is a weak one on the open file.}) 6. b3
d5 $11 {Is some kind of Chebanenko Slav-like play from Black, but as you can
see Black is solid.}) (5. cxb5 axb5 6. Nd4 Ra5 $1 {Quite an original way to
save the pawn!} 7. O-O c5 8. Nb3 Ra7 9. Nc3 Qb6 $11 {Gives Black an equal
position.}) 5... Bb7 6. O-O c5 7. Bb2 Be7 8. d3 O-O 9. Nbd2 d6 {And overall I
have a feeling that Black has an excellent position with queen side space and
totally fine development. He can now develop his knight to c6. Black has
equalised effortlessly out of the opening.} *
