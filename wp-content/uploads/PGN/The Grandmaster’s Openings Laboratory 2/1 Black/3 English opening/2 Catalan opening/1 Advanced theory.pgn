1. c4 Nf6 2. g3 {This is an extremely tricky move order. The point is that
White wants to disallow all forms of b6 lines by Black. At the same time, we
have no knight on c3. so our Bb4 plans will not be possible here. It's time to
go for classical chess and strike in the centre.} e6 3. Nf3 (3. Bg2 d5 {Just
transposes after Nf3.} 4. b3 {Has some independent significance, not because
we cannot play our same Be7 0-0 stuff but because we have a chance here to win
a pawn.} dxc4 5. bxc4 {Can you spot the surprising tactical motif?} Qd4 $1 {Of
course, White can cut his losses and play Nc3, but it would mean he is a pawn
down. Hence he goes for...} 6. Qb3 $2 Qxa1 7. Bxb7 Bxb7 8. Qxb7 Nfd7 $1 {He
finds himself in a position where he is losing a piece.} 9. Qc8+ Ke7 10. Ba3+
Kf6 $19) 3... d5 $1 {The good old classical days are back! d5 is an extremely
logical move, taking centre control.} 4. Bg2 Be7 5. O-O O-O {Both sides have
finished their king side development and now it is for White to decide whether
he would like to take the game into Catalan territory with d4 or to double
fianchetto positions with b3.} 6. d4 (6. b3 {This is a hypermodern approach.
White fianchettos both his bishops. I think the most irritating thing for
White in such positions is when Black doesn't try to do anything special but
just logically keeps developing his pieces.} c5 $1 {More central control.} 7.
Bb2 Nc6 {Once Black has played Nc6 and c5, he is really threatening to play d4
because it will be excellently guarded. Hence White must either now take on d5
or play e3.} 8. e3 {Once White chooses this double fianchetto setup, it is
much more probable that he will go for this line with e3 followed by Nc3.} (8.
cxd5 Nxd5 {This makes White's task to search for an advantage very difficult.}
(8... exd5 9. d4 Ne4 10. dxc5 Bxc5 11. e3 $14 {Leads to a favourable position
for White.}) 9. Nc3 (9. d4 cxd4 10. Nxd4 Bd7 {Is seen in the game
Murshed-Kasimdzhanov.}) 9... Bf6 {In this position White has 2 main moves -
Qc1 and Rc1.} 10. Qc1 (10. Rc1 b6 {Was excellently played by Black in
Praznik-Horvath.}) 10... Nxc3 11. Bxc3 e5 $1 {Setting up the Maroczy Setup and
taking more space.} 12. d3 Be6 {Is analysed in the game Speelman-Ganguly.})
8... b6 {We just continue with our natural play.} 9. Nc3 (9. Qe2 {Doesn't
really have much independent value, as anyhow White will send his queen to e2
in future.}) 9... Ba6 $1 {The bishop is very well placed here, as it puts
pressure on the c4 pawn.} 10. d3 (10. Qe2 {Usually transposes to the same
thing.}) 10... Qd7 11. Qe2 Rad8 12. Rfd1 (12. Rad1 Rfe8 {Is analysed in the
game Radjabov-Naiditsch.}) 12... Rfe8 13. a3 d4 {Was played nicely by black in
the game which we have analysed - Chuchelov-Ghaem Maghami.}) 6... c6 7. Qc2 b6
{We first develop our light-squared bishop and keep open the option of
developing our b8 knight either to d7 or to a6.} 8. Rd1 (8. Nbd2 Bb7 9. e4 {Is
another major opening tabiya and here I recommend, instead of the normal Nbd7,
the more active and a little unusual...} Na6 $1 {When Black has interesting
play.} 10. a3 (10. e5 Nd7 {Is analysed in Wang-Kovalyov.}) 10... c5 {Is seen
in Gonzalez-Kovalyov.}) (8. b3 Nbd7 9. Rd1 Ba6 10. Nbd2 c5 11. e4 {Is seen in
the game Heubner-Anand.}) 8... Nbd7 $1 {Once this rook has been developed to
d1, we no longer need to retain the option of developing the knight to a6 but
instead we will now have to keep open the option of playing Bb7 or Ba6. Hence
now, if White decides to develop his knight to c3, then the ideal position for
the bishop will be on a6; and if the knight is developed on d2, then Bb7 is
fine. If White continues with the main line of Bf4, then we shall continue
with Bb7. Thus we see the amount of subtlety required to gain a good position
with the Black pieces is quite high in such Catalan-type positions.} (8... Bb7
$6 {The main reason why I felt that this is inaccurate is because of White's
move.} 9. b3 $1 {The idea is now to play Nc3 and e4, when we no longer have an
option of playing Ba6 as we have already developed the bishop.} Nbd7 (9... Na6
{Might be an interesting option here, but White can keep an edge after...} 10.
Nc3 c5 11. dxc5 Nxc5 12. Bf4 $14) 10. Nc3 Rc8 11. e4 $14 {Leads to a very
pleasant position for White.} dxe4 12. Nxe4 c5 {Is now bad due to...} 13. Nxf6+
Bxf6 14. Ng5 $1 Bxg5 15. Bxb7 {And Black has a long fight ahead for a draw.})
9. Bf4 (9. b3 Ba6 $1 10. Nbd2 c5 11. e4 {Leads to highly complex and
interesting play. However, we will be well prepared if we follow the analysis
given in the game Huebner-Anand.}) (9. Nc3 Ba6 {Also leads to interesting
positions. There are lot of variations and novelties which are all analysed in
the game Poldauf-Hansen. This is the brief outline of variations.} 10. b3 (10.
Ne5 Nxe5 11. dxe5 Ng4 12. cxd5 exd5 $1 $146 {Gives Black an excellent position.
}) 10... dxc4 11. Ne5 Nxe5 12. dxe5 Nd5 13. bxc4 Bxc4 {Is the critical
position of the opening.}) 9... Bb7 {This is the main position of this opening.
From here almost 500-odd games have been played and it is extensively analysed.
However, this is a classical position, and if we play more such positions then
our understanding of the game will surely improve. Here Black has in mind to
engineer the c5 break and open his position. But it is difficult because of
the rook on d1 standing opposite the queen. So we must try to improve our
pieces and only then go for the c5 break.} 10. Nc3 (10. Ne5 {Has been analysed
in the game Caruana-Adams.} Nh5 11. Bd2 Nhf6 12. cxd5 cxd5 13. Nc6 Bxc6 14.

Harika v Adams and Bauer v Almasi.} *
