1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. Qc2 {White goes for the main line of this
variation. And as White has not grabbed space in the centre with d4, we now
take some space with...} c5 $1 5. a3 {As we already know that after...} (5. g3

7. Qxc3 Qa5 $5) 5... Ba5 6. g3 O-O (6... Nc6 {Was more accurate.}) 7. Bg2 Nc6
8. O-O d6 {Black starts to set up his pawns on dark squares, so that his other
bishop will be a good piece. At the same time, the bishop on a5 will not be
hindered by it.} 9. d3 h6 $1 {Of course, Black wants to play e5; but first he
would like to stop Bg5, which would make him lose control of the d5 square.}
10. e3 e5 11. Nd2 (11. Nd5 {Is another option - but I now consider Black's
best option to be...} Nxd5 12. cxd5 Ne7 {The d5 pawn is attacked, hence it's
now logical to play...} 13. Nd2 b5 $1 {Stopping Nc4 and gaining space on the
queen side.} 14. a4 Bb7 15. axb5 Bxd5 16. e4 Be6 17. Nc4 Bc7 {Black is very
solid. He has ideas like Qd7, attacking the b5 pawn; later to push d5; and
also the possibility, when the a8 rook isn't hanging, of playing f5.} 18. Be3 (

bishop on a5 was standing on that square, precisely to take the knight off the
board at the right moment. And there could not have been a better moment: the
knight was threatening to jump to d5 and hence Black took it before it could
cause any damage.} (11... Be6 12. Nd5 {Is a very irritating position, as now
we cannot get rid of the knight from d5 without giving up our important
light-squared bishop.}) 12. Qxc3 a5 $5 {To stop White from gaining space on
the queen side with b4. Now Black has a positional threat of a5-a4, hence
White is forced to play...} 13. b3 Be6 {Black has extremely harmonious
development. His knights are well placed and his bishop is a good piece,
having central pawns placed on the opposite colour to that of the bishop.
Overall, the opening has gone very well for Black.} 14. f4 {White, seeing that
in order to make best use of his bishops he must open the position, goes for
the move f4.} (14. Ne4 {Was another possibility.} Nxe4 15. dxe4 {This move
tries to prove that d6 is a weakness on the open file, but in fact after...} a4

advantage of them.} 16. b4 Qc7 $1 17. Rd1 (17. b5 Na5 $17) 17... cxb4 18. axb4

with the d6 weakness gone and two queen side passers, Black is clearly better.}
) 14... Qd7 $1 {Balogh Csaba correctly assesses the position and keeps the
tension. He doesn't open the a1-h8 diagonal and also stops f5 for the time
being.} 15. Nf3 Rfe8 $1 {Again, maintaining the tension. This is one of the
most important concepts in chess, i.e. to maintain the tension. Often taking
is a mistake, because by taking something we increase the activity of the
White pieces. Here if White takes, it will increase Black's activity.} 16. Bb2
(16. fxe5 {Winning a pawn is not possible.} dxe5 17. Nxe5 Nxe5 18. Qxe5 Bxc4
19. Qc3 Ba6 $15) 16... Bh3 $1 {Exchanging the crucial king side defender,
after which White's position becomes a little weak.} 17. Qd2 Bxg2 18. Kxg2 Rad8

for his pieces.}) 19. e4 {The further course of this game is not so
interesting from the point of view of the opening.} a4 20. b4 Nd4 21. Rae1 b5

the bishop doing on a5? Well, at least it is doing something better than the
knight on a4!} 12. Be2 Nbd7 13. b3 a6 {Black intends to play b5 and then bring

Maroczy Bind was a strong idea.}) 14. b4 $2 (14. Bb2 b5 15. Nc3 Rac8 $15 {The

here, with the move c5, he has shut down the position and hence his bishops

1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. g4 $5 {The hyper aggressive treatment of the
position. As Akobian shows us, Black must not be afraid of this move - rather,
he must concentrate on his development and look to counterattack in the centre.
} O-O $1 {You might think that Black is playing with fire in this position by
0-0. But in fact this is the right decision. Black wants to open up the centre
with moves like d5 and c5, so it makes sense that his king is castled and safe.
Now it is a race between whether White will be first to attack the Black king
or whether Black will blow open the centre. As we see in this game, Black is
way ahead in this race.} 5. g5 Ne8 $1 {This square is safe and the knight,
specifically, defends the soft g7 square.} 6. Qc2 b6 {I like this development
of the bishop on the long diagonal. It keeps an eye on the f3 knight and does
not let White move his 'e' pawn easily. The bishop will be extremely well
placed on b7.} 7. a3 Bxc3 $1 {Some might say giving up the bishop is not a
good idea. But the thing to note here is that time is the most crucial factor
in the game right now. There is no point in wasting time retreating the bishop.
By taking on c3, we speed up the development of other pieces.} 8. Qxc3 Bb7 9.

the rook lift, Black has stuck to the basics. He has his king castled and has
opened up the centre. Sure enough, we know who is going to succeed!} 11. cxd5

Black has an overwhelming advantage now. He just continues to develop his
pieces!} Nc6 $1 {After 14 moves, it's time to take stock on the development
front. All of Black's minors have been developed and he has castled - while
White has only a knight and queen developed, a rook that went to g1-g3 and
back to g1 and the king that is feeling highly uncomfortable on e1.} 15. Be3

the strength of the great Ivanchuk. He figures out that he can give the
Ukrainian a run for his money by playing this sharp opening, but of course
it's an extremely dangerous strategy to try such risky openings against a
