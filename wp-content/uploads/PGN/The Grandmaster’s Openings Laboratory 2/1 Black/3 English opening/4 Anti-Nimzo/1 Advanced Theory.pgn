1. c4 Nf6 2. Nc3 e6 3. Nf3 (3. d4 Bb4 {We transpose into Nimzo Indian
territory.}) (3. e4 d5 {We transpose into the Mikenas variation that has been
analysed.}) 3... Bb4 {Black places his bishop on b4, as we do in both the Bogo
Indian and Nimzo Indian Defences. The only difference here is that the White
pawn is still on d2. This leads to a game of quite different character, as
here White's c4 pawn, which is usually weak in the Nimzo Indian, is not so
weak. But White's influence in the centre is also less. This line can be
called the "Anti Nimzo Indian".} 4. Qc2 {Out of the many fourth move options,
this one is the most popular at White's disposal. White plays this like the
Qc2 Nimzo Indian. He doesn't want to spoil his pawn structure when Black takes
on c3. He will recapture with the queen. However, this gives Black a chance to
grab space in the centre with...} (4. g3 Bxc3 $5 {Quite a committed decision,
but it gives the game its unique character. And we are not tricked into
studying some main theoretical position.} 5. bxc3 b6 6. Bg2 Bb7 7. O-O O-O 8.
d3 d5 $1 {We prefer this direct central move and will analyse two games based
on it. One game is played by two famous players, Illescas-Polugaevsky, in
which cd5 is played; and the other is between Silva-Giaccio, where Ne5 is
played.} (8... d6 {Is the main line here. It is the choice of many good
players, but after...} 9. e4 Nbd7 {I find the position to be easier for White
to play, as he has more space and two bishops. Black has a solid position but
somehow, in order to counteract White's initiative, he has to play very
carefully - something that is not very easy. However, you can have a look at
this line if you feel like it.}) 9. cxd5 (9. Ne5) 9... exd5) (4. Qb3 {This
move hardly holds any independent value from 4.Qc2, as after...} c5 5. a3 Ba5
6. g3 Nc6 7. Bg2 O-O 8. O-O d6 9. d3 h6 {Later we might take on c3 when it
doesn't matter whether the queen does so from c2 or b3. Overall the nature of
the position remains pretty similar to 4.Qc2.}) (4. g4 $5 {This is a hyper
aggressive approach by White. This move has no real basis as such, because
Black has played all good developing moves, so White cannot be making this
move merely to punish Black. The main reason why this move became popular is
because it leads to interesting positions, which might attract players who
wish to complicate matters.} O-O $1 {We are not afraid of such rash moves and
move our king out of the centre so that we can break through there later. As a
rule, we must always remember: a flank attack must be met with an attack in
the centre.} 5. g5 {If you have said 'a', you must say 'b'.} Ne8 {White has
many ways to play now. But overall the pattern of the game will be similar.
White will try to attack on the Black king side and Black will play in the
centre. Hence it makes more sense to look at illustrative games and remember
how to play this position, rather than to memorise theory or specific move
orders.} 6. Qc2 (6. Rg1 b6 {Will be seen in the top-level battle between
Agrest and Ivanchuk.}) 6... b6 {Will be seen in the game Sales-Akobian.}) (4.
a3 $6 {This move doesn't make any sense. In fact, it just loses a tempo
because Black has already placed his bishop on b4 to take the knight on c3 at
some stage.} Bxc3 5. bxc3 b6 {[%cal Gd7d6,Ge6e5,Gc8b7,Gb8d7,Ge8g8] And we can
continue normal development with Bb7, 0-0 and then c5 Nc6 followed by d5.})
4... c5 $1 5. a3 {It makes sense for White to question the intentions of the
bishop right now. If he doesn't do so, it gives Black additional options.} (5.
g3 {If White delays the move a3, then Black continues with...} Nc6 6. a3 Bxc3
$5 (6... Ba5 {We could very well continue this way, which will transpose into
the main line; but we have an opportunity to exchange on c3 followed by Qa5,
an idea we can keep in mind.}) 7. Qxc3 Qa5 8. Qc2 (8. Qxa5 Nxa5 {Looks at the
weakened b3 square and attacks c4.}) 8... b5 $1 {This energetic move gives
Black a very pleasant position, as he is exchanging the c4 pawn for his b5
pawn.} 9. cxb5 Qxb5 10. Bg2 O-O $11 {As was seen in Grigorian-Romanishin, 1976.
}) 5... Ba5 {White now has two main ways to play: the fianchetto setup with g3
and the more central approach with e3.} 6. g3 (6. e3 {This is another way for
White to play. It is a more central approach but not so frightening for Black.}
O-O {In this variation, Black must 0-0 before playing Nc6, because he would
like to play d5 as soon as possible - even before Nc6 is played.} 7. Be2 (7. d4
b6 (7... cxd4 8. exd4 {[%cal Gc1g5] No point in opening the c1 bishop when our
bishop is out on a5!}) 8. Be2 Bb7 9. O-O Qe7 $1 10. Rd1 d5 $1 {And Black has
good play in the centre. Next he can develop Nc6 and put his rooks on the
central 'd' and 'c' files.}) 7... d5 $1 {It is important to play this move
before Nc6.} (7... Nc6 8. O-O d5 $2 {Now d5 is not possible, as the knight on
c6 will become weak after...} 9. Na4 $1 b6 10. cxd5 exd5 11. b4 $16 {Wins a
piece! Hence we must play d5 before developing Nc6.}) 8. Na4 (8. O-O dxc4 (8...
Nc6 {As we know, is a mistake due to...} 9. Na4 $1) 9. Bxc4 Nc6 10. Be2 Bb6 {
To defend the c5 pawn against Na4 and, more importantly, to stop White from
making the freeing move d4.} 11. Na4 Qd6 12. d4 $1 {Playing d4 before Black
can play e5.} cxd4 13. Nxb6 axb6 14. exd4 Bd7 {Is a safer alternative.} (14...
Nxd4 15. Nxd4 Qxd4 16. Rd1 Qe5 17. Be3 Nd5 18. Bd4 Qd6 19. Qe4 $36 {For a pawn,
White has the initiative.}) 15. Be3 Ne7 $11 {Though White has the bishop pair,
Black has good control of the d5 square and, overall, quite a solid position.})
(8. cxd5 exd5 9. O-O (9. Na4 c4) 9... Nc6 10. Na4 c4 $11 {Black is ok.}) 8...
b6 {Is seen in the illustrative game Spielmann-Maghami.}) 6... Nc6 7. Bg2 O-O
8. O-O {What do we have here? We have a normal looking symmetrical English but
the bishop is quite oddly placed on a5. True, it is looking odd but maybe
isn't so bad. Because of the bishop being outside the pawn chain, Black will
now fix his pawns on dark squares, i.e. on d6 and e5, and thus make his
light-squared bishop into a good piece. In addition, this will increase his
control in the centre.} d6 9. d3 h6 {Preventing Bg5, so that later we don't
have to worry about the Bg5 pin when we go e6-e5.} (9... e5 {Positionally,
would not be the best decision, as then White would be able to exchange one of
Black's key defenders of the d5 square, i.e. the f6 knight, for the c1 bishop,
a piece which will have no influence over the d5 square.} 10. Bg5 $1 {[%csl
Rd5]}) 10. e3 e5 11. Nd2 (11. Nd5 Nxd5 $1 12. cxd5 Ne7 13. Nd2 b5 14. a4 Bb7
$11) 11... Bxc3 $1 {When we develop the bishop on e6 and White plays Nd5, we
will not be able to exchange the d5 knight with our f6 knight. So rather than
let the White knight sit on d5, we exchange it right away.} 12. Qxc3 a5 {
Stopping White's queen side expansion with b4. We analyse this position in
more detail in the game Chuchelov-Balogh. CONCLUSION: the Anti Nimzo Indian
line is an extremely solid weapon for Black, just like Nimzo Indian and Bogo
Indian. And White has a hard time trying to find a way to get an advantage.} *
