{This provides you with an overview as to how to play against the English
Opening. At the same time, we also cover a lot of lines which can begin with 1.
Nf3. So overall you get a repertoire for 1.Nf3 as well as 1.c4. The Catalan
lines covered in this section from the 1.c4 move order show that even 1.d4 is
touched upon in our repertoire. The main coverage is on meeting the three
openings: 1. English Catalan (c4 Nf6 Nf3 e6 g3 d5); 2. Anti Nimzo-Indian (c4
Nf6 Nf3 e6 Nc3 Bb4); 3. Mikenas Flohr Variation (c4 Nf6 Nc3 e6 e4 d5).} 1. c4
Nf6 {Now White has three main choices: 2.Nc3, 2.Nf3 and 2.g3. Usually after 2.
g3, White follows up with 3.Nf3, so they often transpose.} 2. Nf3 (2. Nc3 e6 3.
e4 {The Mikenas Flohr Variation.} (3. d4 Bb4 {Leads to the Nimzo-Indian, which
we have covered in depth.}) (3. Nf3 Bb4 {Leads to the Anti Nimzo variations
which we have considered from the move order 2.Nf3 e6 3.Nc3 Bb4.}) 3... d5 {
Now White has two options. to take on d5 or the main line of pushing e5.} 4. e5
(4. cxd5 exd5 5. e5 (5. exd5 Nxd5 6. Bc4 Nb6 {Followed by Nc6 Bd6 and 0-0, and
Black has an excellent position.}) 5... Ne4 {Following the principle of
maximum activity.} 6. Nxe4 (6. Nf3 Bf5 $1 7. d4 Bb4 {And Black develops
excellent play. It's important to remember that 6.Nf3 must be met with Bf5.}) (
6. d4 Bb4 7. Qa4+ Nc6 8. Bb5 Bd7 {And Black has very good play.}) 6... dxe4 7.
Qa4+ Nc6 8. Qxe4 Qd4 {Gives Black ample compensation for the missing pawn.} 9.
Qxd4 Nxd4 10. Bd3 Be6 11. Ne2 O-O-O $44) 4... d4 $1 {The counterattacking move.
} 5. exf6 dxc3 6. bxc3 (6. fxg7 cxd2+ 7. Bxd2 (7. Qxd2 Qxd2+ 8. Bxd2 Bxg7 $11 {
Black has absolutely no problems.}) 7... Bxg7 8. Qc2 Nc6 9. Bd3 Bd7 10. O-O-O
Qe7 11. a3 O-O-O {With a very interesting position.}) 6... Qxf6 7. d4 (7. Nf3 {
The hypermodern way to play this line doesn't guarantee White any advantage.}
e5 8. Bd3 Bg4 9. Be4 Nd7 $1 {This accurate move is important.} 10. Bxb7 Rb8 11.
Bd5 c6 12. Be4 Nc5 13. Qe2 Nxe4 14. Qxe4 Bxf3 15. Qxf3 Qxf3 16. gxf3 {We must
be well versed with this endgame, as is analysed in our illustrative game.})
7... e5 $1 8. Nf3 Nc6 $1 {We have some fresh analysis in this line and,
according to it, Black is doing really well. This move is stronger than the
more popular move ed4. But it is razor sharp. So I urge the readers to be very
well versed in the subsequent analysis.}) 2... e6 3. g3 {One of the most
complicated systems to face as Black. But simple and solid play assures Black
of a good position.} (3. Nc3 Bb4 {There are mainly three moves for White in
this position: Qc2 - which is by far the main move; g4!? - which is the most
aggressive option at White's disposal; and g3 - which leads to quite
interesting positions as we immediately take on c3.} 4. Qc2 {The main line.
And now we don't give White the chance to win our b4 bishop and play...} (4. g4
O-O $1 {Level-headed play; main idea is to play in the centre.} 5. g5 Ne8 6.
Qc2 (6. Rg1 b6) 6... b6 {Black's main idea will include breaking in the centre
with d5 and c5, rendering White's g4-g5 pointless.}) (4. g3 Bxc3 $5 {To g3 you
must remember to take on c3 and then counter White's fianchetto with our own
fianchetto.} 5. bxc3 b6 6. Bg2 Bb7 7. O-O O-O 8. d3 {And now you must play the
active move...} d5 $1) 4... c5 $1 5. a3 Ba5 6. g3 (6. e3 O-O 7. Be2 d5 $1 {
Gives Black a fully satisfactory position. A point to note here is to play
this before 7...Nc6. The reason is explained in the theory file.}) 6... Nc6 7.
Bg2 O-O 8. O-O d6 {Setting up the pawns with d6 and e5.} 9. d3 h6 $1 {Stopping
Bg5.} 10. e3 e5 11. Nd2 Bxc3 12. Qxc3 a5 {With a very nice position for Black.}
) (3. d4 Bb4+ {Leads to the Bogo-Indian variations.}) 3... d5 $1 (3... a6 {Is
a sideline which you can play when you are trying to outplay a weaker opponent.
}) 4. Bg2 (4. d4 {Provides us with the additional option of giving a check on
b4 and coming back to e7, so that later we avoid all the lines with Nbd2.} Bb4+
5. Bd2 Be7 {All the lines with Nbd2 and e4 are avoided, as well as the b3 and
Bb2 lines.}) 4... Be7 5. O-O O-O 6. d4 {The Catalan is the most sophisticated
opening. We need to be very much aware of all the move order tricks, so that
we can play against this opening confidently with Black.} (6. b3 {In this
double fianchetto, our mantra should be simple: play the most natural moves.}
c5 $1 7. Bb2 Nc6 8. e3 (8. cxd5 Nxd5 $5 9. Nc3 Bf6 {Also helps Black to
equalise with ease.}) 8... b6 9. Nc3 Ba6 $1 10. d3 Qd7 {We put our rooks on d8
and e8 with a fine position.}) 6... c6 7. Qc2 {This is the most popular move
because it keeps all the options open for White.} b6 {Now there are three main
setups you should be aware of: 1.Rd1 followed by Bf4 and Nc3; 2.Rd1 followed
by b3 and Nc3; 3.Nbd2 followed by e4 or b3 Bb2.} 8. Rd1 (8. Nbd2 {When White
plays this move, we must develop our bishop first because we would like to
meet e4 with Na6.} Bb7 9. e4 (9. b3 Nbd7 10. Bb2 Rc8 11. e4 c5 $13 {With an
extremely unclear position.}) 9... Na6 $1 {With this unusual knight
development, we gain a nice position as we have the option of bringing our
knight back to d7 if White plays e5.}) 8... Nbd7 $1 {Once White has put the
rook on d1, we need to keep the option open of developing the bishop on b7 or
a6. Hence first Nbd7 is a better move.} 9. Bf4 (9. b3 Ba6 10. Nc3 (10. Nbd2 c5
{Also leads to very sharp lines.}) 10... dxc4 $5 {With an extremely
complicated game...}) 9... Bb7 10. Nc3 Nh5 11. Bc1 f5 $132 {With a very
interesting stonewall-like position. This makes Black's play in this opening
quite easy, as he has a clear-cut plan to follow.} *
