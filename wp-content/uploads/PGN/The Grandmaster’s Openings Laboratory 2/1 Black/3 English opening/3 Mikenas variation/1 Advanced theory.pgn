1. c4 {The English Opening has been named after the famous English chess
master Howard Staunton. One special characteristic behind this opening is that
it may be transposed into a number of other openings, and that is why many GMs
adopt this opening to confuse their opponent. For example, White may play d4
at any moment and transpose the game to d4 territory, and hence we have
developed this section in tandem with our Bogo Indian and Nimzo Indian
repertoire.} Nf6 2. Nc3 e6 3. e4 $1 {The Mikenas Flohr Variation. It is a very
aggressive line. White combines the closed character of the English Opening
with the open character of 1.e4 openings. Black has many options now, but the
two main choices are 3...c5 or 3...d5. We prefer the latter, as it directly
fights for the space in the centre.} (3. d4 Bb4 {Will transpose into the Nimzo
Indian opening.}) 3... d5 {White really has only two options in this position:
1. to push ahead with e5; 2. to exchange on d5.} 4. e5 {This is the main
position of the Mikenas Variation. Before you start thinking where to retreat
your knight to, try to think if you can make a counterblow!} (4. cxd5 $5 {This
leads to an isolated queen pawn position. But the difference, as compared to
normal IQP positions, is that it will be like a French structure where Black
will have not an 'e' pawn but a 'c 'pawn.} exd5 {White has two possibilities
again, to take on d5 or to push ahead with e5.} 5. e5 $5 {This is much more
challenging.} (5. exd5 $6 {Black gets a very comfortable position after...}
Nxd5 6. Bc4 (6. Nf3 Nc6 7. Bb5 Qe7+ $5 {A very uncomfortable move to meet.} 8.
Qe2 Ndb4 $1 $15 {Black is generating very dangerous threats.}) 6... Nb6 7. Bb3
Nc6 8. Nge2 Bd6 {And Black is more than fine.}) 5... Ne4 $1 {Following the
principle of maximum activity, Black's knight moves forward.} 6. Nf3 (6. d4 $5
{To support the 'e5' pawn is a logical choice.} Bb4 {Developing the bishop and
preparing to 0-0.} 7. Qa4+ {White tries to unsettle Black with this check, but
it only helps in furthering his development.} Nc6 8. Bb5 {White plays
aggressively. But this is really the only good move, because Bd2 will be met
with Nd2 and Nge2 blocks in the f1 bishop.} Bd7 $5 {Logically best! Developing
the last minor piece. If White takes on c6, then Black will first take on c3
with check.} 9. Nge2 (9. Bxc6 Bxc3+ $1 10. bxc3 Bxc6 {And Black is fine.}) 9...
Nxc3 10. bxc3 (10. Nxc3 $2 {A tactical mistake...} Nxd4 11. Bxd7+ Qxd7 $17 {
Black's bishop is safe on b4 due to the Nc2 fork.}) 10... Nxd4 $1 {This tactic
works all the same.} 11. Bxd7+ Qxd7 12. Qxd7+ Kxd7 13. cxb4 Nc2+ 14. Kd2 Nxa1
$11 {White will win back the knight on a1, but Black already has enough
compensation as he is better developed.} 15. Bb2 {This is a highly unbalanced
position, but what we know is that Black - who has two rooks - needs open
lines for them and hence the next move is obvious.} a5 $1 {Trying to open the
lines for the rook.} 16. b5 {Trying to keep it closed.} Nb3+ $1 17. axb3 a4 $1
$13 {Black opens the line for his rooks and the position is very interesting.})
(6. Nxe4 {This is a greedy move and Black gets good compensation for the pawn.}
dxe4 7. Qa4+ {This check is the only logical way to continue - because if
White doesn't do that, then his e5 pawn will become weaker than the Black e4
pawn.} Nc6 $1 {Developing the least active piece.} 8. Qxe4 {White wins a pawn
here, but after...} Qd4 $1 {Principle of maximum activity. Black gets more
than enough compensation for a pawn, because White has a lot of weak squares
down the 'd' file and Black has active pieces.} (8... Be6 $44 {Is also a good
idea, because White's extra pawn means nothing as he is too far behind in
development.}) 9. Qxd4 Nxd4 10. Bd3 Be6 11. Ne2 O-O-O $36 {For a pawn, Black
has the initiative.}) 6... Bf5 {Black develops a piece and defends the e4
knight on its advanced outpost. Developing pieces towards the centre is always
a good idea.} 7. d4 (7. d3 $5 {White forces Black to take on c3, but after...}
Nxc3 8. bxc3 Qd7 9. d4 (9. Nd4 Bg6 $11 {Preparing c5, Nc6 and 0-0-0 with an
equal position.}) 9... c5 10. Ba3 Nc6 11. dxc5 g6 $1 {The bishop comes out via
g7 and Black will soon win back his pawn - leaving White with weak pawns.})
7... Bb4 {Preventing White from preparing 0-0.} 8. Qb3 c5 $1 {Defending the
bishop and also preparing Qa5 to increase pressure on c3.} 9. Bb5+ (9. dxc5 $6
{Is a mistake due to...} Qa5 $1 10. Be2 Nd7 $36 {Black is clearly better.})
9... Nc6 10. O-O $1 (10. Be3 $6 O-O 11. Rc1 Qa5 $17) (10. dxc5 Qa5 $15 {
Pressure on c3 keeps mounting, while Black's next plan is to play Nxc5 - which
is awkward for White to meet.}) 10... O-O 11. dxc5 Nxc3 12. Bxc6 (12. bxc3 Bxc5
$11) 12... bxc6 13. Qxb4 Ne2+ 14. Kh1 d4 $13 {With a very interesting position.
The Black pawn on d3 will be quite strong.}) 4... d4 $1 {A very nice
counterattacking move in the centre by Black. He doesn't want to retreat his
knight to a passive square like d7.} 5. exf6 {This is the best move in the
position.} (5. Nb5 $6 {White tries to be tricky but he will be in trouble
after...} Nfd7 $1 6. Nxd4 c5 7. Nb5 (7. Ndf3 Nc6 $15 {Black will win back the
pawn.}) 7... Nxe5 $15 {Followed by a6 and Nc6, and Black has a nice position.})
5... dxc3 6. bxc3 (6. fxg7 $5 {White cannot win a pawn due to the cd2 check.
It's very funny that both White and Black are only one rank away from queening
when it's just the sixth move!} cxd2+ 7. Bxd2 (7. Qxd2 Qxd2+ 8. Bxd2 Bxg7 $11
9. O-O-O Nc6 10. Nf3 e5 $1 {Black makes use of his central pawns.} 11. Bc3 O-O
12. Bd3 (12. c5 Be6 13. Bb5 f6 $1 $15) 12... f5 13. c5 e4 14. Bc4+ Kh8 15. Nd4
(15. Ng5 Bxc3 16. bxc3 Ne5 $17) 15... Ne5 $13 {The position is complicated,
but Black is not worse. He can develop his light-squared bishop to d7 and
connect the rooks.}) 7... Bxg7 8. Qc2 Nc6 9. Nf3 Bd7 10. Bd3 Qe7 {Now
threatening Nb4, winning the bishop pair.} 11. a3 (11. Bxh7 O-O-O $36) 11...
O-O-O $11 {Black has a very good position. His plan can include a safety move
like Kb8 and then start mobilising the central pawns with f5 and later, after
preparation, e5. These ideas are looked into in the game Cafferty-Milner Barry.
}) 6... Qxf6 {Earlier in this position it was understood that there is only
one way for White to play and that is with d4. But players like Aronian have
shown that it is possible firstly to play Nf3 followed by Bd3, bringing the
bishop to c2, and then playing d4. Of course, playing d4 remains the main
option - but we cannot discount the other hypermodern idea.} 7. d4 (7. Nf3 e5
$5 {We keep our approach the same - that is, to strike in the centre with e5.}
8. Bd3 (8. Qe2 $6 {Tries to win a pawn, but it will not be a good deal for
White as he is wasting a lot of time in the opening.} Nc6 9. d4 Bg4 {
Developing pieces and preparing 0-0-0.} 10. dxe5 (10. d5 $5 {All of White's
previous moves are fruitless, as the e5 pawn is now safe.} Bxf3 11. gxf3 Ne7
12. Rb1 O-O-O $13 {With the idea of c6 - breaking White's centre.}) 10... Qf5
$15 {Black has lost a pawn; but White's pawns are so mangled that, in spite of
being a pawn up, White is worse off.}) 8... Bg4 $5 {The idea is simply to
destroy White's king side pawn structure.} 9. Be4 {The bishop comes to a very
commanding position: Black must do something to dislodge it. And hence the
next move...} Nd7 $1 {Black is ready to give up a pawn ,so that he can bring
his knight to c5 from where it will create pressure on the bishop on e4.} (9...
Nc6 {Is possible, but now the bishop on e4 feels very comfortable as no one
can dislodge it.}) 10. Bxb7 Rb8 11. Bd5 {This has been played in two top-level
games.} (11. Be4 $5 Nc5 $44 {With compensation for his pawn in terms of active
pieces...} 12. Qc2 Nxe4 13. Qxe4 Bxf3 14. Qxf3 Qxf3 15. gxf3 {How to play such
an endgame will be seen in our illustrative games.}) (11. Rb1 c6 $1 {A very
strong move - trapping the bishop on b7.} 12. d4 Be7 {Black is ready to 0-0,
and moves like e4 are coming up; White is in deep trouble.}) 11... c6 12. Be4
Nc5 13. Qc2 Nxe4 14. Qxe4 Bxf3 15. Qxf3 Qxf3 16. gxf3 {This endgame is highly
unbalanced and something we should know how to play. As it stands, the
position is dynamically equal. We study this endgame in Movsesian-Naiditsch.})
7... e5 {Black strikes back in the centre, snatching some space and opening up
the light-squared bishop. Of course, Black can only hope that White will push
d5, so that he can use the c5 square for his knight or bishop.} 8. Nf3 $1 {
This is the strongest move, keeping the tension in the position.} (8. Qe2 {Is
possible, but again its sole function is to win a pawn - which will just ruin
White's pawn structure. Hence this is a bad move.} Be7 $5 {Black sees no
reason for clinging on to his e5 pawn. If White takes on e5, his pawns will be
very weak; and if he doesn't, then Qe2 is a useless move.} 9. dxe5 (9. Qxe5 $6
Qxe5+ 10. dxe5 Nc6 11. Nf3 Bg4 12. Be2 O-O-O $44 {Black is simply better.} 13.
Bf4 Rhe8 14. O-O g5 $1 15. Bg3 f5 $40) 9... Qg6 10. Qe3 Nc6 11. Ne2 Be6 12. Nf4
Qc2 $44 13. Nxe6 fxe6 14. Qd3 Qxd3 15. Bxd3 Nxe5 $11) 8... Nc6 $1 {Black
maintains the tension in the centre and is ready to apply more pressure with
Bg4. A majority of the games had continued earlier with ed4. But, as we
already know, it's a good idea not to give up the centre and to maintain the
tension. Every time we release the tension, we help our opponent to increase
his activity. White must be careful not to slide into an inferior position now.
Not many games have been played in this line. So what follows is almost
original analysis. Sagar: 'As we know from the main theory file, this is the
main line. In this position, I think the most obvious move is Bg5! It is an
active move and gains a tempo over the Black queen'.} (8... exd4 {I analysed
this move extensively and came to the conclusion that Black has to play very
accurately to hold the balance - something that is possible for strong GMs but
not for mere mortals! So I think 8... Nc6 is better.}) 9. Bg5 {This seems like
the most natural move. White follows the principle of maximum activity and
develops his bishop on the farthest square possible, at the same time
attacking the Black queen.} (9. dxe5 $2 {Is considered in the game Kosten-So.}
Nxe5 10. Qe2 Bd6 11. c5 O-O $1 12. cxd6 Bg4 $19 {Black is already winning.}) (
9. Nxe5 {Is a much better option for White than de5, but still falls short of
gaining an advantage.} Nxe5 10. Qe2 Be6 11. dxe5 (11. Qxe5 Qxe5+ 12. dxe5 Bc5
$44 {White has horrible pawns and Black has wonderful development.}) 11... Qf5
$11) 9... Qg6 10. d5 {This is the main line.} (10. dxe5 Bg4 11. Be3 (11. h4 Bc5
$15) 11... Rd8 12. Qb3 Bxf3 13. gxf3 Be7 14. Qxb7 O-O $36 {Black is ahead in
development and White has a lot of pawn weaknesses. Black has excellent
chances of gaining an advantage here.}) (10. Bd3 $6 {Is a natural move but
runs into...} e4 11. Qe2 f5 12. Bf4 Be7 13. d5 exd3 14. Qxd3 Nb8 $17 {Black
has won some material, will castle soon and is clearly better.}) 10... Nb8 $5 {
What exactly is Black doing? He seems to have broken all the opening rules. 1.
has not developed any pieces; 2. has brought out the queen early in the
opening. How can this be any good? The reason is: Black has a structural
advantage. He has a better pawn structure, a very strong central pawn on e5,
which restricts the enemy pieces, and an excellent square on c5. At the same
time, even though he is behind in development, his pieces have excellent
squares, e.g. Bf8 can go to d6, Bc8 can go to g4 and Nb8 can go to c5 via d7
or a6. Hence Black has an excellent position.} 11. Bd3 {White further
increases his initiative by bring out another piece.} (11. h4 $5 {Now the e5
pawn is hanging, as the g5 bishop is defended.} e4 $1 $146 12. Nd4 (12. h5 Qf5
13. Qe2 {This position is so complicated. The f3 knight is attacked. It cannot
move because the g5 bishop will hang. But currently the e4 pawn is immobile,
as it is pinned. White has an idea of increasing the pressure on the e4 pawn
with Rh4!} Na6 (13... Bd6 14. Rh4 $36) (13... Nd7 {Runs into problem as the f5
square's control has been lost and in the variation...} 14. Bh4 Bd6 15. Nd4 $1

Nd4 Qe5 $11 {Once Black creates this blockade of Bd6 and Nc5 then, more often
than not, he is fine.}) 12... Bd6 {Black develops his bishop on a nice square,
keeping c5 free for his knight.} 13. Be2 {Threatening to trap the Black queen
with Bh5.} (13. Nb5 h6 14. Be3 O-O 15. Nxd6 cxd6 16. h5 Qf5 17. Be2 Nd7 $11)

will make use of the weakened c5 square for his knight.} 16. O-O Nd7 $11 {The
queen looks weird on h7, but apart from that Black's position is very
harmonious.}) (11. Qd2 h6 12. Be3 Nd7 {The dark-squared bishop will go to d6
and the knight to c5. in this way, Black will have great control of the dark
squares.} 13. Be2 Bd6 $15) 11... f5 $1 $146 {Black already has a slight
advantage.} (11... Bf5 {Everyone has only ever played this move, which gives
White a small edge after...} 12. Qa4+ $1 Bd7 13. Qc2 f5 {Finally, Black has to
play this move, so then why not on move 11?}) 12. Qe2 e4 13. h4 (13. Bf4 Qxg2
$19) 13... Nd7 (13... Na6 $6 14. Bc2 h6 15. Ba4+ {Is the reason why we must
develop our knight on d7 and not a6.}) 14. Nd4 (14. Bc2 h6 15. Bf4 Qxg2 $19)

better - as his knight is very strong on c5 and he has very good centre
control.} *
