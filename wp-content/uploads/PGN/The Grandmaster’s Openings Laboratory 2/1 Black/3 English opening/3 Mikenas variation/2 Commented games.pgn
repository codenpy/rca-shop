in this game is the way we should also play.} 1. c4 Nf6 2. Nc3 e6 3. e4 d5 4.
e5 d4 5. exf6 dxc3 6. fxg7 {This move is very unambitious, as it gives Black
equal chances quite easily.} cxd2+ 7. Bxd2 {White first take on g7 - showing
lack of ambition - and now he takes on d2 with the bishop instead of the queen,
showing that he wants to fight for an opening advantage! According to me, the
White player is confused! But leaving aside all these prejudices, this
position is quite complicated and interesting because of an asymmetrical pawn
structure. One of Black's main advantages is that he has an extra central pawn,
the 'e' pawn, which gives him additional central control.} Bxg7 8. Qc2 {
Defending the b2 pawn.} Nc6 9. Nf3 Qe7 (9... Bd7 {Is also possible, followed
by Qe7 and 0-0-0.}) 10. Bd3 Bd7 (10... Nb4 {Is still not possible because of...

Nd4. White figures out that Black is a little low on space, so he wants to
avoid exchanges. And, true enough, if Black could play Nd4 followed by Bc6, he
could be better.} (12. O-O-O Nd4 $1 {Easing off the space issue with a few
exchanges.} 13. Nxd4 Bxd4 14. Bc3 (14. Bxh7 f5 $19) 14... Bc6 $15) (12. Bxh7 {
Taking this pawn is never an option due to...} f5 $19) (12. O-O Nd4 13. Nxd4

gives Black a nice position.}) 12... Kb8 (12... f5 {Black could have directly
started with this move. The idea now is to play Rhf8 followed by e5. I think
currently it was more important to grab the space in the centre rather than
put the king into safety. However, the Kb8 move doesn't hurt Black.} 13. O-O-O
Rhf8 14. Bg5 Bf6 15. Bh6 {Was better.} (15. Bxf6 $6 Qxf6 $15 {Now e5 cannot be
stopped and Black is better.}) 15... Rg8 16. g3 Be8 $1 $15 {Transferring the
bishop to a better diagonal.}) 13. O-O-O f5 $1 {Black plays in the spirit of
his pawn structure, trying to grab more and more space in the centre.} 14. Rhe1
Rhf8 $1 {Defending the f5 pawn, so as to make e5 possible.} 15. Bg5 {The most
natural move.} (15. Kb1 {The main idea of this move is to avoid a check from
g5 later on, when the tactical variations emerge down the 'e' file.} e5 16. Bg5

Qxf6 {Now the entire battle will revolve around the fact whether Black can get
to e5 or not. Because if Black can play e5, he will have very strong central
control; and if he can't, then the pawns on f5 and e6 will remain weak. Taking
these factors into consideration, White wasn't on top of his game and played a
normal move which would have given Black the advantage.} 17. Qe2 $6 (17. Qc3 $1

bxc3 $13 {Though White has ruined his pawn structure, now executing e5 will be
difficult and Black will be able to blockade the pawns. That means the e6 pawn
will be weak and the bishop on d7 would not be such a strong piece. Hence this
position is dynamically balanced: White's bad pawn structure v Black's not so
good bishop.}) 17... e5 $2 {There was no need to give up the pawn: Black could
have just played Rfe8. Maybe he was afraid that his pawns would be blockaded.}

Rd2 would fail to Nb3.} 19. Nxd7+ Rxd7 20. Qe5 Qg5+ 21. Kb1 Qxg2 22. Bxf5 Qxf2

Usually when you face lower-rated players, you can expect them to play this
way. It is their thinking that a queen exchange increases their chance of
gaining an equal position and later a draw. However, we should be happy when
we see this, because it helps us to get a very active position right out of
the opening.} Qxd2+ 8. Bxd2 Bxg7 {[%csl Gg7][%cal Gg7b2] The bishop on g7 is a
powerhouse of strength, as it shoots down the long diagonal. b2 is attacked

quick piece development, because he would like to play e5 and f5, and take
control of the centre.} 10. Nf3 O-O $5 (10... e5 {Was a much more accurate way

1. c4 Nf6 2. Nc3 e6 3. e4 d5 4. e5 d4 5. exf6 dxc3 6. bxc3 Qxf6 7. Nf3 {With
this move, White signals his hypermodern strategy. He does not want to capture
the centre with d4, instead first developing the bishop on d3 and - only after
Bc2 - playing d4.} e5 8. Bd3 Bg4 $1 {A very logical move, adhering to the
principle of maximum activity. It's true that by the principle of least active
piece, we must develop our knights before the bishop, but in this particular
case we are still not sure whether we want the knight to be developed on d7 or
c6, and hence we first develop our light-squared bishop. We are now
threatening to take on f3 and ruin White's pawn structure.} 9. Be4 $1 {The
bishop turns out to be very strong on this square. It not only defends the f3
knight and prevents White's structure from being spoilt, but it also attack
the Black queen side which has been weakened due to the early development of
the bishop on g4.} Nd7 $1 {Fantastic concept introduced by Naiditsch!! He
develops his least active piece to a square from where it can eye the weakened
c5 square and attack the e4 bishop. Thus, in a way, this move is aimed at
neutralising the activity of the e4 bishop at the earliest possible
opportunity. The cost of this is the b7 pawn, but Black is ready to pay that
price.} (9... c6 {Would look like the most natural move, blunting the bishop;
but it runs into the very annoying move...} 10. d4 $1 $16 {When White is

that the pawn on is on h3 instead of h2. Maybe it's a fact that ever so

reach a position that is extremely imbalanced. White has an extra pawn. In

White's extra pawn doesn't really count right now, as it will take a long time
to realise its strength; meanwhile, Black must try to take up as many active
posts as possible for his four pieces. (Yes in the endgame, the king is also
an important piece).} Kd7 {In the endgame, even the king is a fighting unit.}
17. Ke2 Bd6 {In a way, taking aim at the h2 pawn and clearing the way for the

the e8 rook can lift itself to the third rank and start attacking the 'h' pawn.

more than White.} 19. d3 f5 $1 {Central expansion.} 20. h3 f4 $1 {You might
ask now - what is Black doing? Isn't placing all the pawns on the same colour

will now be attacked by the rook.} 21. Kf1 {Preparing d4.} g5 22. d4 exd4 {

winning position.}) 13. Bxd3 O-O $1 {Safeguarding the king. Let's have a look
at this position and talk about it. Material is even, but White's pawns are
horrible. It might seem he is just worse - but that will be a static point of
view. What is more important to note is that White is extremely well developed
and has the better pieces. If Black can quench White's activity, then he can
be better - but as of now his work is cut out to play carefully.} 14. Qc2 (14.

try.} 13. f4 O-O 14. O-O Nc6 15. d5 Ne7 {White is slightly better, but Black
can equalise if he makes good accurate moves. This is a position that is not
so much fun for Black to play.}) 9. dxe5 $6 {This move is a bad mistake. Of
course, positionally you can clearly see that this move leaves the 'c' pawns
horribly weak, as they are doubled and isolated, But White is trying to take
advantage of short-term tactics, namely the pin down the 'e' file. The problem
is that Black wriggles out of it and all that White is left is with manifold
weaknesses.} Nxe5 $1 {Rising up to the challenge is what you can expect from a
talented youngster like So Wesley.} 10. Qe2 {The only move that justifies
White's prior play.} Bd6 $1 11. Bg5 (11. c5 {Might have been the reason why
White played this way, but he must have realised a little too late that Black

lost.} 12. cxd6 Bg4 $1 {The knight on f3 is now badly pinned.} 13. Qxe5 Rae8 $1

weaknesses.} 12. Nd4 {Thinking that the queen will move off the 'e' file and
then White can win a piece with f4. But Black has a surprise ready...} Nd3+ $1

the bishop back and forth was carried out, so that now the e4 square is
totally in Black's control!} 17. Nxd6+ cxd6 18. Kf3 f6 19. Bh4 Bd7 $17 {With

a tempo over the Black queen.} 9. Bg5 Qg6 10. d5 (10. dxe5 Bg4 11. Be3 Rd8 12.

in development but has structural advantage going for him. In such situations,
it is important to check the concrete variations that we have analysed above,
because if you make a mistake, then you will land in trouble. However, if you
play accurately, then you can expect great positions!} 1-0
