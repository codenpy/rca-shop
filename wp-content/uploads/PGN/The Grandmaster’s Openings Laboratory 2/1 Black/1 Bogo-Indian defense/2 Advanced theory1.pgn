1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 Bb4+ {The Bogo Indian is very interesting, because
it limits White's options only to two moves now: Bd2 and Nbd2. If White plays
Nc3, then why would he play 3.Nf3 instead of 3.Nc3?} 4. Bd2 Qe7 5. g3 Nc6 $1 {
Putting pressure on the d4 pawn.} 6. Bg2 Bxd2+ $1 {Correct timing! White would
want to recapture on d2 with the queen and put his b1 knight on c3, but it
runs into concrete problems due to the knight on c6.} 7. Nbxd2 (7. Qxd2 $6 Ne4
$1 8. Qc2 Qb4+ $1 9. Nc3 (9. Nbd2 Nxd2 10. Qxd2 (10. Nxd2 Nxd4) 10... Qxc4 {
Black wins an easy pawn.}) 9... Nxc3 10. Qxc3 Qxc3+ 11. bxc3 d6 12. Nd2 Na5 $15
{Black has the better position already, with the idea of maybe Rb8 b6 and Ba6
attacking the weak c4 pawn.}) 7... O-O 8. O-O d6 9. e4 e5 10. d5 Nb8 {This is
the important position of this variation. Black is positionally very sound. He
has a King's Indian pawn structure without the bad dark-squared bishop! Isn't
that wonderful! Secondly, he has a clear plan for placing his pieces, almost
irrespective of what White wants to do. First of all, he goes a5 then Na6, Bd7
and breaks with c6, generating good queen side play. In general, White has a
space advantage but his g2 bishop is not very active. All in all, this
position is strategically very rich and produces highly interesting games.
White has two main plans: 1. Ne1-d3, improving the knight then later playing
b4 or f4; 2. b4 with queen side expansion. Out of 659 positions to reach this
position, 423 have continued with Ne1 and 171 have continued via b4. So it
makes sense to pay particular attention to these two possibilities.} 11. Ne1 {
This knight will go to d3, from where it can be useful to engineer f4 and king
side play as well as b4 and queen side play.} (11. b4 a5 $1 {Black starts by
attacking the White queen side. Of course, advancing the b pawn will give
Black a wonderful outpost on c5 for his knight.} 12. a3 Na6 $1 {This is the
best square for the knight, because from here it not only exerts pressure on
the b4 pawn but also, in case of ba5 or b5, can jump into the very desirable
c5 square.} 13. Qb3 (13. Ne1 {Is possible, but it will transpose to 11.Ne1.})
13... c6 {This move is also an important part of Black's plan, because if
White takes dc6, then - after bc6 - he loses the space advantage in the centre.
Thus White will have to allow Black to capture on d5 when Black wants to. If
White then recaptures ed5, this leaves e pawn to move forward - sometimes even
e5-e4-e3; and if White takes cd5, then the bishop will get a good square on b5
from d7.} 14. Ne1 (14. Rfc1 axb4 $1 (14... Bd7 15. c5 $1 {This strong move
gives White the advantage. It is something that we must avoid.} (15. h3 {This
passive move helps us to understand one of the key ideas in this variation.}

against Lev Psakhis.} 16. axb4 c5 17. b5 Nb4 $11 {The knight on b4 stands
pretty strong.}) 15... cxd5 16. exd5 dxc5 17. bxa5 {Only when the c5 square is

will be met with Nb5-d4.} 21. c5 Nb5 22. Nc4 dxc5 23. bxc5 Nd4 24. Qd1 Be4 $11
{Even though White has a dangerous passed pawn on d5, our idea of h5-h4-h3 has
been a huge success: the White king is cramped for space and, secondly, the
knight on d4 is a spectacular piece. After the exchange of light-squared
bishops, the light squares in White's camp will be extremely weak.}) 11... a5
