$15) 7... d6 {Black chooses a different way to reach our tabiya position.
Usually the moves d6,0-0 and a5 can be interchanged, but I would recommend
starting with 0-0 then d6-e5 and then, if White pushes us back, we can play a5.
But, at the same time, it's good to know that there are other move orders
available.} (7... O-O 8. O-O d6 9. e4 e5 10. d5 Nb8 11. Ne1 a5 {We reach the
same position as in the game.}) 8. O-O a5 9. e4 e5 10. d5 Nb8 $1 (10... Nd8 {
The knight from here has no scope whatsoever.}) 11. Ne1 O-O 12. Nd3 Na6 $1 {We
already know that the knight is best placed here, putting pressure on the b4
square and, at the same time, looking to jump into the c5 square at the right
moment.} 13. f4 {Once your opponent starts his attack with f4, your knee-jerk
reaction should be counterplay in the centre with c6.} c6 $1 14. f5 {I don't
like this move at all. First of all, White loses his flexibility of attack;
secondly, he places one more pawn on a light square, thereby limiting his g2
bishop.} cxd5 15. cxd5 $6 {After this move, Black need not worry at all!} (15.
exd5 {Is the better way to recapture. White must have not recaptured with the
'e' pawn because he must have been afraid that Black would continue e5-e4; but
here it's not possible to play e4.} Qc7 $1 (15... e4 $2 16. Nxe4 $1 Nxe4 17.
Qe2 Re8 18. Rae1 Qc7 19. Bxe4 Qxc4 20. f6 {White has a dangerous attack.}) 16.
Qe2 Bd7 {Simple development - White doesn't have any chance of a successful
attack, as he has lost his stability in the centre; but if he is persistent
and tries for the g4-g5 idea, he will soon be pushed away} 17. g4 Nc5 18. Nxc5

not succeeded and Black has his own counterplay going!}) 15... Bd7 $1 {As we
already know that exchange of a white knight for the d7 bishop is in Black's
favour, Bb5 is a threat now. Exchanging the d3 knight would mean that, after
Nfd7, both Black knights can control the great square on c5 but the White
bishop cannot. It will soon lead to a good knight v bad bishop scenario, as
happens in the game.} 16. Nc4 (16. a4 b5 $1) 16... Bb5 {One of the knights
will be exchanged for the bishop now.} 17. b3 Bxc4 $1 18. bxc4 {After Black
took on c4, the c5 square has become a permanent outpost - both the knights
can reach that square; the bishop on g2 is like a dead dodo!} Qc7 {Bringing
the queen to the queen side before embarking on a Nfd7-c5 manoeuvre.} 19. Rc1

careful that our king is not left without defenders. Let's take a sample line.}

taken on a totally different character, about which White would be very happy.}

Kh8 23. Qh4 Qe7 24. Bh3 {The threat now is Bf5.} Rg8 25. Bf5 Rg7 {Black has
successfully defended, but look at the light-squared bishop on f5; from a poor
one, it has been converted into a monster piece! Maybe Black is better but it
just shows that you can never leave your king very lonely!} 26. Nf2 {The
knight is coming to g4, from where it will attack the f6 pawn.} Nc7 27. Ng4 Ne8
{Phew!! - with some nimble-footed manoeuvring, Black is clinging on! But for
how long - and don't you think this position is quite messy?}) (19... Nc5 {
Didn't seem so bad; but the knight, when it goes to b4, opens the 'a' file for
the Black rook.}) 20. Nxb4 (20. Qb3 {Seemed like a better choice; why open the
'a' file for the rook?} Ng4 $1 {How should White defend now?} 21. Nxb4 Qc5+ 22.
Kh1 axb4 23. h3 Ra3 $1 {Is the reason why opening the 'a' file can be so
dangerous for White.} 24. Qb2 Ne3 25. Rf3 Nxc4 $19) 20... axb4 {The rook on a8
is activated immediately and the a2 pawn is now a weak link on the open file.}
21. Qe2 Qc5+ 22. Kh1 (22. Qf2 {What should Black play?} Rxa2 $1 $17) 22... Ra3
$1 {The rook makes full use of the 'a' file and now is dangerous - not only on
the 'a' file but also on the third rank. Not to forget that the other rook on
f8 is eager to join the party!} 23. Bf3 Rfa8 24. Rc2 {Maximum activity has
been achieved by Black; it's time now to think of the next phase of the plan.}
Re3 $1 {With this move, the other rook may come to a3 and Black's pieces start
infiltrating the White camp. Do you see why this is happening? Look at the
Black pieces - how are they entering White's territory? You are right, if you
said through the dark squares! Because White has a light-squared bishop and
all his central pawns are on light squares, he is seriously weak on dark
squares and hence is in a horrible state.} (24... Qe3 {Was not bad either;
after the queen exchange, defence of the a2 pawn will become more difficult,
but counterattacking possibilities for White also increase, because he is no
longer afraid of an attack on his king.}) 25. Qg2 Qd4 {The queen enters the
enemy camp.} 26. Rd1 {Now it's time to employ a simplification tactic, which
just enhances Black's advantage!} Qxd1+ $1 27. Bxd1 Re1+ 28. Qg1 Rxg1+ 29. Kxg1
Nxe4 {The important pawn on e4 falls - this is a thorough win for Black's
strategy. He first forced all of White's pawns on to light squares. then
exchanged both of White's knights while keeping his own knight which dominates
the light-squared White bishop.} 30. Rb2 Nc5 31. Kf1 (31. Rxb4 Rxa2 32. Rb6 Ra1
$19) 31... Kf8 {The king comes in to defend d6 if need arises.} 32. Bc2 {
Trying to go to b1 to defend the a2 pawn; but as Nimzowitsch had said, the
open file is not only for frontal attack but can be used as a jumping point to
go to the other files. Black plays...} Ra3 $1 33. Bd1 (33. Bb1 Rf3+) 33... Ke7
34. g4 Kf6 35. h4 {It's time for the last of Black's pieces to penetrate into
White's position on dark squares - how will you achieve it?} e4 $1 {e5 is
cleared for the king.} 36. g5+ Ke5 37. h5 Rg3 {White loses another pawn and
resigned soon afterwards.} 38. g6 hxg6 0-1

a3 Bg4 $1 {I like this move and recommend it wholeheartedly. As we know that
Qc2 will be met with Be2 and Qe1 is not so comfortable, that leaves only the
option of f3 - which reduces the options of the g2 bishop even further.} 14. f3

Black is having all the fun here!}) 17... axb4 18. axb4 Nc7 $1 {This is a very

works like clockwork from here.} 19. Qb2 (19. Nc4 Nb5 20. Nb6 Nd4 21. Qb2 Rxa1

to give it up - hence it makes sense to play Ba6.} 22. Qxd3 $14) 22. Rc1 Nb5

try this line gives us a huge boost. It has to be good if Ivanchuk could beat

knight on e5 away. It's quite surprising that Ivanchuk didn't go in for the
simplifying...} (14... Bxc3 $1 15. Bxc3 d5 {At this point, I prefer Black's
position because his pawn structure is more compact and his pieces are well
placed. By 'compact pawn structure' I mean that while White has a weak pawn on
b3, Black doesn't have one; besides, against a hanging pawn structure that
will arise after a mass exchange in the centre, knights can attack the central
pawns better than bishops.} 16. Rfd1 Ne4 17. Rac1 f6 18. Nd3 cxd4 19. Bxd4 (19.

timing! This is how it is usually done: you take on c3 with your bishop and,
when the White bishop comes to c3, you play d5, so that the d4 pawn remains on
the dark square and the bishop on c3 isn't very active.} 18. Bxc3 d5 {Ivanchuk
has equalised in this position and I like his chances better, because the
bishop on c3 is restricted by the d4 pawn.} 19. Ne5 Qb7 20. Rac1 dxc4 21. Qxb7

and attack the two hanging pawns. The position might be objectively equal but

Ivanchuk was able to subdue his opponent.} Rc7 23. Bb4 Rac8 24. Rb1 Nd7 25.

Krasimir. My opponent was taking time for all his moves upto this point. He
had nearly used up 15 minutes while I sat prettily on 1hr 34 mins! It made me
feel that he had come unprepared. But the next two moves were made quickly by
him. I feel that he luring me into playing this line. However I was confident
about the quality of the move and would not mind repeating it again.} 11. cxd5
{His explanation for making this move was that white shouldnt allow both d5
and c5 by black.} exd5 12. e3 Nc6 {I remembered my analysis that Nc6 was the
best move here.} 13. a3 $5 {He was making all the computer moves which made me
feel he had come prepared.} Bxa3 14. Ng5 (14. Ne5 Nd8 $1 {gives black a chance

continue playing for a win with Nb8. However I decided to first see his
intentions whether he wants to draw or not by playing Nb4. In a way it was a
good decision because he used a lot of time. So we reached the same position
but due the repetition he was down by 20 mins! A good decision for me.} Nb4 18.

and I too think the same. The fact that the computer doesnt agree and thinks
this is a good move is because he is a computer and can calculate everything.
For humans it is better to not make such weakening moves because they cannot
follow up as accurately as the computer can. Mainly I made this move to reduce
the pressure on the d5 pawn.} (23... a5 24. h4 Na6 25. g5 hxg5 26. hxg5 Nd7 27.

would get a strong attack which is very possible. And surprisingly he accepted
it.} 1/2-1/2
