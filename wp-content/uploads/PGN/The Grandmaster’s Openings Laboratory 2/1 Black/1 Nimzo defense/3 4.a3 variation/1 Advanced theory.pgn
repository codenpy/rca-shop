1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. a3 {This is the most direct move in the Nimzo
Indian. It directly questions the basis of the Nimzo Indian Defence. White
asks the bishop on b4 what exactly it is doing there? Is it worth it to give
up the bishop pair just for the sake of doubling White's pawns? The answer to
this question, if you are a Nimzo Indian player, is a resounding YES!} Bxc3+ 5.
bxc3 c5 $1 {This move is usually the start of Black's source of counterplay in
this position. How should one start to attack a weakness? According to
Nimzowitsch, one must first fix a weakness and then start to attack it.
Following this logic, the move c5 fixes the c4 weakness - which will now be
attacked.} 6. e3 (6. f3 {Intending e4, must be met with...} d5 $1 {And we have
a transposition to the 4.f3 Saemisch Variation.}) (6. Bg5 {Trying to remove
the bishop outside the pawn chain of e3 might be logical, but it fails here
due to...} Qa5 $1 {And I think the best that White can do now is to retreat
his bishop to d2, which would mean a serious loss of time.}) 6... Nc6 {The
knight is developed to this square so that it can go to a5 and attack the pawn.
} 7. Bd3 O-O {Black gets 0-0 over and done with. The next phase of his plan is
to play b6-Ba6-Na5, with high pressure on the c4 pawn.} 8. Ne2 (8. e4 $5 {
Might seem that it simply loses a pawn, but it's a very tricky move.} cxd4 (
8... Ne8 9. Be3 {Gives White some additional options.}) 9. cxd4 d5 $1 {This
central break is, in fact, the right way to gain an advantage for Black. The
complications of this move are analysed in the annotated games section between
Irina Krush-Bryan Smith. It must be noted, though, that taking the pawn is not
such a great idea.} (9... Nxd4 $6 {White now has...} 10. e5 $1 {And it might
seem that Qa5 will win the pawn on e5, but after...} Qa5+ {Picking up the e5
pawn...} 11. Kf1 Qxe5 $2 12. Bb2 {Black is badly pinned and there is no
defence against Bd4 followed by Bh7+.})) (8. Nf3 {Some of you might be asking,
why not this natural move? The answer to that is: Black has a clear-cut plan
ready to attack the c4 pawn with Na5-Ba6. In retaliation, White must start
with an attack on the king side by launching his 'f' pawn forward. But now the
knight on f3 just comes in the way. White's play on the king side is slowed
down terribly because of the blocking of the 'f' pawn.} d6 $1 {So as to meet
the move e4 with e5.} (8... b6 9. O-O Ba6 10. e4 Ne8 11. e5 f5 12. d5 Na5 13.
d6 $16 {Leads to not a very pleasant position for Black, as his knight on e8
is almost trapped.}) 9. e4 e5 $1 10. d5 (10. Bg5 {We must always check if this
pin is possible or not.} cxd4 11. cxd4 exd4 12. O-O h6 13. Bh4 Re8 $15 {Black
doesn't have many problems. If need arises, we can break the pin with g5 and
later blockade on dark squares like e5 and c5 in the centre.}) 10... Ne7 {This
position represents the Huebner wall, which we will cover in the 4.e3 section.
Just note that Black is a tempo up here and he is totally fine.}) 8... b6 {
Following the plan of attacking c4 with Ba6.} 9. e4 Ne8 $1 {This idea is so
famous now. But it was first introduced by the great Capablanca in his game
against Johner Paul at Karlsbad in 1929. The following are the advantages of
this move: 1. Bg5 would be a highly irritating pin for Black, as he lacks a
dark-squared bishop - this move prevents it; 2. White's plan is later to
launch an attack with f4-f5 and maybe even f6 - hence Black is now ready to
meet f4 with f5; 3. lastly, the knight can, at some stage, come out on d6 to
enhance the pressure on the c4 pawn.} 10. O-O Ba6 11. f4 {This is a logical
way for White to continue his attack.} f5 $1 {This is a key move in Black's
play. The f4 pawn is stopped right in its tracks, so the bishop on c1 becomes
a little passive.} 12. Ng3 (12. d5 exd5 13. cxd5 (13. exd5 Na5) 13... Bxd3 14.
Qxd3 fxe4 15. Qxe4 Nd6 16. Qd3 Na5 $15 {In the game Radjabov-Leko in the
annotated games section, the Black player shows that this line is just plain
bad for White.}) (12. e5 d6 13. d5 exd5 14. cxd5 Bxd3 15. Qxd3 dxe5 $17 {Check
the game Carlsen-Aronian in the annotated games section.}) (12. exf5 exf5 13.

18. Qxc6 Bb7 (18... Bxc4 19. Rfe1) 19. Qa4 h5 {This interesting position is
further checked in the game Pedersen-Schandorff in the annotated games section.
}) 12... g6 13. Be3 (13. exf5 {Has no independent value and just transposes to
12.ef5.} exf5 14. dxc5 bxc5 15. Be3 {Is a transposition.}) 13... cxd4 $1 (13...
Nd6 {Karpov had previously beaten Jussupow with this move, which also is very
good; but somehow I like the move cd4, as it's much clearer.}) 14. cxd4 d5 15.
cxd5 Bxd3 16. Qxd3 fxe4 17. Qxe4 Qxd5 18. Qxd5 exd5 $15 {Check the game
Jussupow-Karpov to see how Karpov used his legendary technique to beat
Jussupow.} *
