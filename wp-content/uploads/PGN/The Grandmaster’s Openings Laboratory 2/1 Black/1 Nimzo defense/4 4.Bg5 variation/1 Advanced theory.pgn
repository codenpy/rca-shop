1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. Bg5 {This is the start of the Leningrad
Variation championed by the former world champion Boris Spassky. It is a very
active continuation but positionally isn't very sound. Black can, with the
help of certain ideas, neutralise White's activity and leave White with lots
of positional weaknesses.} c5 5. d5 (5. e3 {Is a horrible move and is met with
the strong...} Qa5 $1 $15 {The threat now is cd4 attacking the g5 bishop at
the same time, then Bc3 winning a pawn. Add to it the threat of Ne4 and Black
is clearly better already!} 6. Bxf6 Bxc3+ 7. bxc3 Qxc3+ 8. Ke2 gxf6 9. Rc1 Qa5
$17) 5... h6 {Just probing the bishop and pushing it back to h4. Of course,
moving the bishop anywhere else would be waste of time and taking on f6 is
surely out of the question!} 6. Bh4 Bxc3+ $1 {I find this to be the right
moment to take on c3 and ruin the White pawn structure before White can play
Rc1 and recapture on c3 with the rook.} 7. bxc3 d6 {Black's idea is very
simple: he gave up his dark-squared bishop and is now playing to put all his
pawns on dark squares whereby his other bishop will be a good piece. White has
the dark-squared bishop in order to compensate for his static weakness of
doubled pawns. So if Black can contain the activity of that bishop, then he
will be better. The pawns on e5-d6-c5 will do just that, i.e. their role in
limiting White's dark-squared bishop.} 8. e3 (8. f3 e5 9. e4 Nbd7 10. Bd3 Nf8
11. Ne2 g5 12. Bf2 Ng6 {Black has a decent position, mainly because the bishop
on d3 looks like a prisoner! The sad thing for White is that keeping it on the
board is bad because it's so passive and trying to exchange it via a4 would
leave the c4 pawn weak in the future! So White does best not to push his pawn
to e4, rather to keep it on e3.}) 8... e5 {I like to call this setup of
c5-d6-e5 as the 'wall'. Black has setup the wall. From this position, White
has three options: Qc2, Bd3 and f3. Our approach against all three moves is
quite unique. I could very well have recommended you just one setup and you
could have blindly played that against any move. But I think it makes more
sense to understand the drawbacks of each move and to exploit them.} 9. Qc2 (9.
Bd3 {This move calls for immediate action with...} e4 $1 10. Bc2 (10. Bxf6 Qxf6
11. Bxe4 Qxc3+ 12. Ke2 Qxc4+ 13. Bd3 (13. Kf3 f5 $19 {Mate threat on g4.})
13... Qb4 $17 {Black is just better.}) (10. Bxe4 $2 g5 $1 {Just drops a piece.}
) 10... g5 (10... Nbd7 {Allows an interesting move.} 11. f4 $5) 11. Bg3 {Black
would like to develop Nbd7 but d6 would hang, hence first we start with...} Qe7
) (9. f3 {This move is also often made.} Bf5 $1 {Black makes this move to stop
White's normal development with Bd3. If White plays Bd3, then Black will
exchange it and his pawn on c4 will become quite weak; and if White plays e4,
then after Bc8 the White light-squared bishop will have absolutely no scope.})
9... Qe7 10. Nf3 Kd8 $5 {Did I by mistake touch the king or what! Well, this
move needs some explanation. Though not the most popular move, I think it is
very good. The idea is to put the king on c7 where it will be extremely safe.
Of course, the annotated games will reinforce my words with variations. Once
we have found a space for the king, we can continue with our normal
development and engage in a full-blooded fight on the king side.} (10... g5 11.
Bg3 Nh5 12. Bd3 Nd7 {Is another way to play.}) 11. Nd2 Kc7 12. Bd3 g5 13. Bg3
Nh5 {This position is analysed in two games: Jussupow-Short and Gokhale-Sagar
in the annotated games section.} *
