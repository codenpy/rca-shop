1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. Bg5 h6 (4... c5 {Is the move order that I
recommend. But more often than not, it leads to the same position.}) 5. Bh4 c5

avoided doubled pawns with this move, but falls behind in development.} O-O 8.
a3 Bxc3+ 9. Rxc3 g5 10. Bg3 Ne4 $17) 7... Bxc3+ 8. bxc3 e5 9. Bd3 e4 $1 {I
like this concrete move. Black snatches space in the centre of the board and
gets an outpost on the e5 square for his knight from d7.} 10. Bc2 (10. Bxe4 $2
g5 $19) (10. Bxf6 Qxf6 11. Bxe4 Qxc3+ 12. Ke2 Qxc4+ $17) 10... g5 {Black
should not be afraid to make this move in this variation. His king is, after
all, not going to 0-0. And hence this move should be played without any fear.
It helps to restrict the dark-squared bishop.} 11. Bg3 Qe7 {To defend the d6
pawn so that Nbd7 is possible.} 12. h4 Rg8 {Avoiding any confrontations along
the 'h' file.} 13. hxg5 hxg5 14. Ne2 Nbd7 15. Qb1 {This move keeps up the
pressure on the e4 pawn and prevents Black from playing Ne5. But it's just a
preventive move. On its own, the move Qb1 is not so useful! Now Karpov
executes one of the most important manoeuvres in this variation.} Kd8 $1 {Are
we out of our mind?? Well not really! This move helps us to safeguard the king
on the c7 square. It is one of the safest squares in this position. From c7,
the only way to attack is on the 'b' file. When White doubles on that file,
Black plays b6 and meets a4 with a5. True, the b6 pawn is weak - but Nd7
supports it and the light square c6 will be defended by the bishop. In short,
the king will be totally safe on c7, giving Black the opportunity to expand on
the king side with his pawns} 16. a4 a5 $1 {It makes sense to prevent a5 from
White and also to render the light-squared bishop even more passive than
before!} 17. Ra2 Kc7 {The king is well placed on the c7 square.} 18. Rh6 Ra6 $5
{Karpov wants to activate his rook from the 'b' file. Though this was not
obligatory, this move is pretty good as it also gives protection to the d6
square.} 19. Qb5 Kb8 {The king now goes safely to a7, then maybe move the d7
knight and push the queen away with Bd7.} 20. Rb2 Ka7 (20... Rb6 {Was also
possible to win some material.} 21. Qxd7 $5 Bxd7 22. Rxb6 Ne8 23. Rhxd6 Ka7 {
And Black is better - but Karpov never likes to give an opponent even one bit
of counterplay.}) 21. Qb3 (21. Kd2 Ng4 22. Rh1 Nb6 {With the idea of Bd7 to
give Black a good position.}) 21... Ng4 {Now Black starts pushing White back.}
22. Rh1 f5 $1 {Black has achieved the maximum in this position. He has pushed
White back and now his next aim is to make the f5-f4 break possible. Once that
is achieved, Black will have a winning position. Look how Black's king is so
safe.} 23. Kd1 Rb6 24. Qa2 Rxb2 25. Qxb2 b6 {The dark squares are controlled
by the pawns and the light square by the bishop. Besides, the true weakness of
the c4 square is shown now when the bishop goes to a6..} 26. Bb3 Ba6 27. Nc1
Nde5 {C4 is super weak now.} 28. Qe2 Ng6 {The knight relocates to make the f4
break possible.} 29. Kd2 Nf6 30. Qd1 f4 $19 {Total demolition by Karpov. His
play can be described as follows: 1. gain space in the centre with e5-e4; 2.
reduce the scope of the dark-squared bishop with h6-g5; 3. safeguard the king
with Kd8-c7; make some preparatory moves on the queen side and safeguard the
position on that side of the board; 4. and finally, switch to the king side to
launch a decisive pawn storm.} 0-1

would like to play Bd3 without allowing the move e4 from Black - hence he
played f3. But Black now develops his bishop on that diagonal, to d3. He is
ready to exchange the bishops, after which the c4 pawn will become a potential
weakness.} 10. Qb3 (10. e4 Bc8 {The bishop returns back. But look at the
damage it has caused - the f1 bishop is totally passive now!}) 10... b6 11. h3

play h3? If he wanted to play g4, he could already have done it.} Nbd7 12. g4

move is nothing new.} 14. Bf2 h5 (14... e4 {Would be strongly met with...} 15.

{The main point in this position is that the 'h' pawn, with the two bishops,
gives Black enough compensation. But Black will sacrifice his exchange back

can be executed even before developing the queen side pieces.} 11. Nd2 Kc7 {As
always, the king is extremely safe here.} 12. Bd3 g5 13. Bg3 Nh5 {Not that we
would like to take the bishop on g3. We may or we may not: we just keep a
watch on it. Maybe some day we could also plan Ng7 and f5.} 14. O-O-O $5 {I
have a belief that Black is simply better in this position. This is due to the
fact that he had given up his bishop on c3. So we can say that the
dark-squared bishop is White's prized possession for the queen side weaknesses
that he has incurred. But that bishop is causing not even a little bit of harm
to Black. Hence the pawn weaknesses remain, which will soon be counted in the
endgame.} Nd7 15. Rde1 {Angling to break open the position with f4.} Ndf6 16.

bishop. But Black is having none of it: he takes the bishop off the board.} (

meant when I said that the knight on h5 keeps an eye on the bishop on g3 and
takes it at the most appropriate moment.} 17. hxg3 Bg4 $15 {White is saddled
with pawn weaknesses and Black has his development in order. In short,
advantage Black.}) 16... Nxg3 17. hxg3 Bd7 {Completing his development. The

clearly pushing.} 20. Ka1 Rhg8 21. f4 {White had to make this move to protect
his g3 weakness.} h4 $1 {A highly unexpected move! The point is that the 'e'
pawn is pinned, as the rook on e1 is unprotected and the g3 pawn will support
the rook on h4; so after Rh4 ef4, White will be in a situation as to how to
recapture f4!} 22. Rxh4 exf4 23. gxf4 Nxd5 $1 {Black wins back the pawn and
now exposes White's structure even further.} 24. Rhh1 Nb6 {The c4 pawn is now

possible moment looks quite attractive to me. To keep pressure on g3 bishop
with knight on h5 is very irritating for White and then to exchange it at the
right moment and push the king side pawns is strategically very difficult to
counter. All in all, I would say it's quite a joy to see 4.Bg5 on the board!}

can play for a few moves and see how the computer's evaluation loses faith in
White's position.}) 17. a5 Ng4 {A move just to provoke some reaction from

raise the threat of f5 if the queen moves somewhere.} (17... Bd7 {Was another

What I would like to take out of this is that my opponent - an experienced IM
- had been playing the Leningrad system for years. I, on the other hand,
prepared against it for a few hours and was able to hold him to a relatively
easy draw! It just shows that Black really is fine in this position.} 1/2-1/2
