1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 {This is the starting position of the opening
envisaged by a great chess mind - Aron Nimzowitsch. He himself would be
pleased to see how popular his opening has been, even till the present day.
Whether it be the World Championships or a small local event, you will see the
Nimzo Indian cropping up, mainly because of its flexibility. It has variations
that will please the tactician as well as a positional master! After move 3,
White has a large choice at his disposal. Broadly, he has 6 main options: a) 4.
a3. b) 4.Bg5. c) 4.g3. d) 4.e3. e) 4.f3. f) 4.Qc2.} 4. Qc2 {Is by far the most
popular choice for White.} (4. Bg5 {The Leningrad Variation is a favourite of
Spassky, but I think it's not such a good variation for White. Black can hope
for a great game afterwards.} c5 5. d5 h6 6. Bh4 Bxc3+ 7. bxc3 d6 8. e3 e5 {
Setting up a wall; a position where each of White's options of Bd3, Qc2 and f3
are analysed.}) (4. g3 {The Fianchetto line was considered toothless until
Kasparov himself used it to score some victories. Our repertoire is simple and
strong.} c5 5. Nf3 cxd4 6. Nxd4 Ne4 7. Qd3 (7. Qc2 {A move that was previously
not very popular is now played quite a bit.} Qa5 8. Bg2 $1 Nxc3 9. O-O $1 {
White has played very imaginatively and Black has to be very accurate to
equalise the game.}) 7... Qa5 8. Nb3 Nxc3 $1 {Yes, sacrificing the queen; but
taking it is not such a great idea, as you will see in the theory section. The
main line runs...} 9. Bd2 Ne4 10. Qxe4 Bxd2+ 11. Nxd2 O-O 12. Bg2 Nc6 13. Qe3
d5 {With an extremely popular position which we analyse in quite some depth.})
(4. e3 {The Rubinstein Variation is maybe the second most popular line after
Qc2 against the Nimzo Indian. White's modest development must not be taken
lightly, as the number of set-ups White has at his disposal are many.} c5 {
After this position, White has 3 set-ups: 1.Nge2 followed by a3; 2.Bd3 and
Nge2; 3.Bd3 and Nf3. Each of these set-ups is analysed in the theory and
annotated games section.} 5. Bd3 (5. Nge2 {Some books have been written
recently on this move and hence it has risen in popularity. We choose a move
order whereby we retain our dark-squared bishop and retain the tension in the
position.} b6 6. a3 Ba5 7. Rb1 Na6 $13 {With an unconventional and complicated
game...}) 5... Nc6 6. Nf3 (6. Nge2 cxd4 7. exd4 d5 8. cxd5 Nxd5 9. O-O O-O {
Quite a pleasant isolated queen pawn position for Black arises, where we
follow a plan that was found by the great Ivanchuk.}) 6... Bxc3+ $1 {We take
the knight immediately and set-up the Huebner Wall.} 7. bxc3 d6 8. e4 e5 9. d5
Ne7) (4. f3 {The Samisch Variation is played by aggressive White players, but
I think in the Nimzo It just encourages Black to play classically and exploit
White's slow development.} d5 $1 5. a3 Bxc3+ 6. bxc3 c5 7. cxd5 Nxd5 (7... exd5
8. e3 c4 $5 {We analyse a famous game in this position between Kasparov and
Polgar. We can use this variation when we are in a must-win situation.}) 8.
dxc5 Qa5 9. e4 Nf6 10. Be3 O-O {And Black will try to exploit the weaknesses
in White's queen side, sometimes even by sacrificing a pawn.}) (4. a3 {The
most direct way to play against the Nimzo Indian, but I don't think Black has
any problems if he is well prepared.} Bxc3+ 5. bxc3 c5 6. e3 Nc6 7. Bd3 O-O 8.
Ne2 b6 9. e4 Ne8 $1 {An important move, avoiding the Bg5 pin.} 10. O-O Ba6 11.
f4 f5 $1 {Stopping the 'f' pawn in its track. This position is analysed in
depth by considering all the possibilities that White has. Black's score from
this position has been phenomenal, so we have nothing to worry us!}) 4... O-O
5. a3 (5. e4 {Is an aggressive system. The positions arising are extremely
complicated, but I think Black in no way stands worse.} d5 $1 {This is the
most reliable way for Black to meet White's central expansion. With good
analysis, we can come to the conclusion that Black can hold his own in this
position.}) 5... Bxc3+ 6. Qxc3 b5 $1 {The Vitolinsh or Adorjan Gambit! How can
one justify a move like this? Well, it is possible only because of White's
king side pieces. Rh1, Ng1 and Bf1 all on their initial squares calls for
powerful play, and that is exactly what Black does - even at the cost of a
pawn.} 7. cxb5 c6 $1 8. Bg5 {The main move and one that you must be prepared
to face the most if you play this gambit line.} (8. bxc6 Nxc6 $44 {Gives Black
ample compensation; we will consider two games with it.}) (8. f3 Nd5 {Is also
seen...}) 8... cxb5 9. e3 Bb7 10. Nf3 h6 11. Bh4 (11. Bxf6 {Is also considered,
but I don't think it is dangerous.}) 11... a6 12. Bd3 Nc6 13. O-O Rc8 {Black
has very smooth development and his future plans include capturing the light
squares on the queen side with Na5.} *
