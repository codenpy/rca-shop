positional pawn b6 is very common in this line. You can always try this. It

sacrifice, as always, is very interesting.} 16. cxb6 axb6 {Now the a3 pawn is

Bb5 Bd7 (18... Ba6 19. a4 {Is another possibility.} Bxb5 20. axb5 Nbd7 {
Similar to the game, only that instead of the c3 pawn there is a pawn on a3 in
the game. This position is very favourable for Black, as he has clear play
down the 'a' file.}) 19. c4 Bxb5 20. cxb5 Nbd7 $44 {Black has a super
coordinated position.} 21. Bd4 e5 22. Be3 {Black is better developed, his king
is safer; the White king isn't so safe, hence the next move is pretty obvious
yet very strong!} f5 $1 {After this, White cover for his king will be ripped
open.} 23. Qa2+ Kh8 24. exf5 e4 {The game went on for another few moves, but

thematic queen side pawn sacrifice with b6 which opens the 'a' and 'c' files;
and the opening up of the king side position with f5 when the queen side has
been stabilised.} 0-1

position.} Nfd7 12. a4 {So that later White can defend his c5 pawn with Qa3,
where it cannot be attacked by any Black piece.} Qc7 13. Qa3 b6 $1 {This is
the best move in the position. White sacrifices the pawn and we open lines
towards the White queen side. This sacrifice is very similar to the one which
Korchnoi used in his famous win against Kasparov in their Candidates
semi-final game 1 in 1983 - a game that is a must-watch to understand this
pawn sacrifice theme.} 14. a5 (14. cxb6 axb6 {Is analysed in the game
Ipatov-Fedorchuk.}) 14... bxc5 {If you are giving me the pawn, then I will
take it!} 15. Nh3 $6 {This gives Black easy equality. The critical move in
this position, and the one that has been lately played by Ding Liren and Wang
hao, is a6. We shall analyse it in the next game - Berry-Maki Uuro.} Ba6 $1 {
Blocking the pawn on a5 and speeding up the development. I think this move
just feels naturally right for Black.} 16. Bxa6 Nxa6 {Black is slightly ahead
in development and can use the 'b' file to infiltrate White's position. At the
same time, it's unclear as to what the knight on h3 is doing.} 17. Qa4 (17. O-O

knights are eyeing the juicy d3 and b3 squares.} 18. O-O Rab8 {The rook also
has an opportunity just to land on b3.} 19. Rfd1 Ne5 {Threatening Nd3.} 20. Nf2

wriggle out from with Qc5+; but still this seemed liked the best move.} Rfc8

knight from landing on d3.} 21. Bxc5 Qxc5 $17 {Black is just clearly better
now. He is well on his way to victory because of the d3 and the b3 square
weaknesses.} 22. Rd4 Rb3 23. Rad1 Rxc3 24. Rd8 Nd3 25. Rxf8+ Kxf8 26. Qa2 Ra3

I think this is the most critical move. It kind of hems in the Black pieces.

his next move is pretty forced.} c4 $1 {Cutting off the f1 bishop and gaining
more space. Now the a6 pawn is threatened.} 16. Qa5 (16. Ne2 Bxa6 17. Qa5 {And

breakthrough. The most challenging move here is a5 - but what happens if White
takes the pawn? Fedorchuk just shows the easiest way to equalise the game.} 14.

White has two weak pawns - c3 and a4; 2. both are on open files; 3. White is
behind in development; 4. Black's knights have an excellent outpost on c5.} 15.
Nh3 Ba6 $1 {Speeding up the development.} 16. Bxa6 Nxa6 {Black's knights have
an excellent square on c5. White has an extra pawn, but I think he will be the
one who will have to fight for equality as two of his pawns - c3 and a4 - are
weaker than the b6 pawn.} 17. O-O Nac5 18. Qb4 Ra5 $1 {By doubling on the 'a'

is the first game in the database that required no variations. Black's play
was so simple: he just sacrificed the 'b' pawn to get good play down the 'a'
and 'c' files, and then used his superior pieces to win back the pawn and
equalise the position.} 1/2-1/2

comfortably developed his bishop on d3 and then Ne2, then he would have a very
good position - similar to the famous game Botvinnik-Capablance AVRO 1938. But
here we just put a stop to Bd3 and hence we prevent White from developing
naturally.} 9. Ne2 Nc6 10. g4 $1 {Kasparov realises that king side expansion

aiming for d3 later; Black can also bring his bishop into play with Bd7-a4.

will not get mated on the king side.} 12. O-O Nb3 13. Ra2 $1 {The rook will

another idea to protect the g4 pawn, so that e4 is possible. But now the

difficult.} 16. e4 $3 {What an amazing move by Kasparov! He understands
dynamics so well. The two exclamations are not for the strength of the move
but for the realisation that this is the only way to gain counterplay. He is
ready to give up a pawn in order to make e4 possible. The position is
extremely complicated, but I think Judit has her chances. The thing is that
Kasparov is a better player in such positions and hence he went on to beat

crushing win in this game, you will agree that the position arrived at from

clamp on White's position. White needed to show some creativity, as was
illustrated by Kasparov. If White hadn't shown it, then he would have been
crushed!} 1-0
