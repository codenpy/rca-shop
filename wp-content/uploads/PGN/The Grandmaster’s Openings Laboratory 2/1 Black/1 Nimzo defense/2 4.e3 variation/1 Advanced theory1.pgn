1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e3 c5 {This is the move if you want to play
in the spirit of how Nimzowitch liked to play the Nimzo, i.e. give White
doubled pawns and then play on them and not undouble them by playing d5. This
line guarantees such strategically rich positions that it will definitely help
any player to improve his understanding of the game of chess! From this
position, there are basically three set-ups for White: 1. with Nge2 and later
play a3; 2. with Bd3 and Nge2; 3.with Bd3 and Nf3, which is the most popular.}

a safe position. I tried to analyse the pawn grab with Bg2 instead of d5, but
it just seemed that White was getting too much play. However, the analysis of
this line you can find in the game Socko-Moiseenko.} 11. cxd5 cxd4 $1 12. exd4

a3 {White has to make this move to prevent Nb4 in reply to Qd3.} Qc7 $1 {This
plan was originated by Ivanchuk, who wanted to place his rook on d8 to
pressurise the 'd' pawn.} 13. Qd3 Rd8 {Rogers-Ivanchuk and Milov-Gelfand are
two wonderful examples of the viability of this position for Black. We shall
analyse this position further in Rogers-Ivanchuk}) 6... Bxc3+ $1 {You might be
wondering why it is that Black specifically took the knight on this move
unprovoked and not two moves earlier? What difference does it make? The answer
is that the f3 knight is not so well placed. White would very much want to
play f4 but the knight being on f3 it will waste a tempo in moving away, and
that tempo is the precise reason why we take on c3 without being forced to by
the move a3 and enter the BLOCKADE SYSTEM' - also known as the Huebner wall.}
7. bxc3 d6 {After Black has exchanged his dark-squared bishop, he goes about
setting up pawns on dark squares so that his remaining bishop is unimpeded.
White has a variety of plans, but Black's remains one and the same: place his
pawns on the opposite colour to his bishop and then try to keep the centre
closed. If the centre remains closed, then Black's knights will turn out to be
superior than White's bishops. The most important thing to remember is 'BLACK
WANTS THE CENTRE TO REMAIN CLOSED AND WHITE WANTS IT OPEN. THE PLAYER WHO
EMPLOYS HIS PLAN SUCCESSFULLY IS THE WINNER'.} 8. e4 {Once White makes this
move, we move into the blockade of the centre.} (8. O-O e5 9. Nd2 {This
approach is advocated by Ivan Sokolov. He likes to keep the centre fluid
rather than blocked - and later tries to open it with f4.} (9. dxe5 {Looks
pretty silly when you see the terrible state of the 'c' pawns - but it has
specific aims in mind, that is, trying to exploit the slight lead in
development and also trying to open the position when you have the bishop pair.
} dxe5 10. Qc2 O-O 11. Ng5 {Well, White now wants to reroute his knight to e4
and then, after Ne4 Be4, wants to plonk his bishop into the strong d5 square
where it will rule like a king.} Kh8 $1 {A novelty by Roman Dzindzichashivili.
Now taking on h7 isn't possible and Black gets a favourable version of all the
above variations.} (11... g6 $6 12. f4 {With the weakening of the dark squares
around the Black king, this move gains in strength and I guess White enjoys an
advantage}) (11... h6 $6 12. Ne4 Nxe4 13. Bxe4 $14 {Now the bishop comes into
d5 followed by e4 - and White has all that he desires.}) 12. Ne4 {But what
about this move? Well, here's the point...} (12. Nxh7 Nxh7 13. Bxh7 g6 14. Bxg6

position for Black.})) (12. Bxh7 g6 13. Bxg6 fxg6 14. Qxg6 Qe7 {And again,
White's sacrifice can at best be termed 'dubious' and three pawns look
insufficient.}) (12. f4 h6 13. Ne4 exf4 14. exf4 b6 {Looks better.} 15. Rd1
Nxe4 16. Bxe4 Qf6) 12... Bf5 $1 {And now Nf6 doesn't come with a check! So
Black exchanges pieces, which always accentuates the weaknesses in White's
camp.} 13. Nxc5 Bxd3 14. Nxd3 e4 15. Nb4 {Black seems to have enough
compensation because of the whole on d3 and poor pawn structure for White.} Ne5
{With more than sufficient compensation for the pawn.}) (9. d5 {Looks pretty
natural, but may not be White's best effort because he doesn't want to block
the centre.} Ne7 10. Qc2 {Trying to keep the diagonal open looks logical, but
the c1 bishop isn't feeling too happy about it.} (10. e4 h6 $1 {A little pawn
move which lays the foundation of the plan for Black. White wants to open the
position using an f4 break. What Black does is to play g5 followed by Ng6,
when playing f4 will be a distant possibility. Black has a comfortable game
after this little pawn push.} 11. Nh4 g5 $1 {A move based on precise
calculations and the right timing.} 12. Nf5 Nxf5 13. exf5 e4 $1 {If it were
not for this move, then Black would be severely cramped. Now I think he has
the advantage.} 14. Re1 (14. Bxe4 Nxe4 15. Re1 Bxf5 16. f3 Qe7 17. fxe4 Bxe4

tactics come to Black's rescue. Try to find Black's best move!} (11. Nd2 {

on the agenda.} g6 $5 {Directed against f4.} 12. f4 exf4 13. exf4 (13. Rxf4 Nf5
