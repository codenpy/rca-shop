1. e4 d5 2. e5 {Declining the Scandinavian this way serves only as a strategic
mistake.. .as White now has to face a better version of French Defence here.}
c5 $1 {Delaying the development of the flexible 'c8' bishop... Black
concentrates on taking space on the queen side for the time being.} 3. f4 {To
create a pawn chain in the centre - this move is obvious.} Nc6 $1 {Again delay.
.. Black is smartly waiting for White's king side knight to come to the f3
square.} 4. Nf3 Bg4 {This is the time to develop the flexible piece.} 5. Be2 e6
{You can see; only after developing the c8 bishop, Black plays e6...)} 6. O-O
c4 {Creating space on c5 for his bishop and increasing pressure on White's
camp by occupying the d3 and b3 squares!} 7. d4 cxd3 8. Qxd3 Bc5+ 9. Kh1 Nge7 {
Black converted to a French-like position with his extra bishop on g4!! I hope
you know that, in the French Defence, this g4 bishop is usually lying idle on
its original square 'c8'.} 10. c3 Nf5 $5 (10... O-O $1 {Accurate choice and
our recommended move in this variation. We should complete the development in
opening before implementing any plan.} 11. Be3 Bxe3 12. Qxe3 Nf5 13. Qd2 Qb6
$15 {Black's queen is dominating the key central diagonal, all his pieces are
in active position, his rooks are already connected, he has a very strong
centre... on the other hand, White suffers from lack of development and his
pieces are not in ideal positions; again, his king is in a sort of stalemate
position!}) 11. b4 Bb6 12. b5 Bxf3 $6 {Black missed an opportunity to take the
lead; again, it's not the proper time to exchange this strong bishop for the
knight unless it has been a forced move.} (12... Na5 $1 {This simple
forwarding move helps Black in two ways: firstly, it opens up the 'c' file for
his major pieces; and secondly, the a5 knight has eyes for the important c4
outpost, which will paralyse White's queen side.} 13. Bd1 (13. Nd4 Bxe2 14.
Nxe2 Nc4 $17) 13... Rc8 $17 {Black dominates all over the board; we hardly
need to say that Black is clearly ahead.}) 13. Qxf3 Na5 {Late, a little bit.}

Black's incorrect play in the previous position.} Qd7 15. a4 Nb3 (15... O-O $5

good position for Black.}) 16. Bxf5 $2 (16. Ra2 $5 Nxc1 17. Rxc1 Nh4 18. Qg3

or strength is!} (16... Nxa1 $1 17. Bd3 Nb3 18. f5 Nxc1 19. Rxc1 g6 $17 {

{This next game was played between two amateurs who committed lots of mistakes.
Still, I need to consider it to present it before you for the sake of the
importance of the opening theory.} 1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Nf6 {Another plus point of
this move is that many players don't prepare it by considering it a dubious
opening for Black! And they are soon out of the theory after only a few moves.}
3. Bb5+ Bd7 $1 {Better than Nbd7, since White is forced to take a decision now
which is good for Black.} 4. Be2 (4. Bc4 $5 {Also quite possible; you may see
the 'theory section' for this variation.}) 4... Nxd5 {There is no reason to
ignore the 'd5' centre pawn at this moment.} 5. d4 Bf5 $1 {Important move -
develop the bishop before you play e6.} 6. c4 $6 {Too optimistic! Breaking the
golden rule - "Trust but verify". White assumes that Black's knight will go to
b6 or f6; but in reality it will not happen in this case, because there is no
pawn at a3.} (6. a3 $5 {Please see theory section.}) 6... Nb4 $1 {This is the
main drawback of White's previous move; when you attack something it shouldn't
advance!} 7. Na3 $8 (7. Qa4+ $2 {Also fails due to...} N8c6 $1 8. d5 Nc2+ 9.

problems at all.}) 8... Qxd1+ {Typical Scandinavian queen exchange. You may
imagine why it is different to other gambits. Even after the queen exchange,
Black is better in the endgame due to his activity.} 9. Bxd1 Nd3+ {This knight
starts paralysis in White's camp} 10. Ke2 Nxe5 (10... Bxa3 $5 {Also

Black technically wins here.} 13. Kf4 Ng6+ 14. Kg3 Na6 $17) 12. Ba4 Nbc6 13.
