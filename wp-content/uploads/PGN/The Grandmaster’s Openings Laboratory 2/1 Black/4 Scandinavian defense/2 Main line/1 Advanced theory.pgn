1. e4 d5 {(I have already mentioned in my first opening course that the
Scandinavian Defence is one of the good responses for Black against 1.e4!)} 2.
exd5 (2. e5 $6 {(A purely strategic mistake.... because now, White has to play
against Black's better version of the French, i.e. with a good light-squared
bishop for Black.)} c5 $1 {(Black's plan is clear.. Nc6, Bf5/ Bg4 & ..e6, thus
getting a French-like position without any bad bishop at c8!!)} 3. f4 {
(Obvious move after White's early e5 pawn push to maintain the pawn chain at
the centre.)} Nc6 {(Delaying the development of the c8 bishop for one move, to
pin the knight if White plays Nf3 in the next move...)} 4. c3 (4. Nf3 $5 Bg4 5.

position, i.e. a central pawn structure...} (5... Bh5 $2 6. g4 Bg6 7. f5 $16)

defender of the d4 pawn, which is now a target for attack.} 7. Be2 Qb6 $15 {
(Black finally gets a French-like position with an extra piece at g4 pinning
the vital knight... better position for Black!)}) (2. Nc3 {[This move
transposes into another opening (after 1.Nc3-d5 2. e4). You'll find an
analysis of this variation in the section "1.Nc3 opening"]}) 2... Nf6 3. Nf3 (

level.)} Bd7 4. Bc4 (4. Be2 $5 {(Important alternative...)} Nxd5 5. d4 Bf5 6.

that in 4.Be2 retreat, this knight (d5) comes to f6 then aims for 'e4'... in
other variations (e.g. 4. Bc4 retreat) it goes to b6.)} 10. Nc3 Ne4 11. Bd3 (

endgame for Black}) (4. Bxd7+ $6 Qxd7 $1 5. c4 c6 6. dxc6 Nxc6 $44) 4... Bg4 {

to give up the d1-h5 diagonal and f3 square for his knight!)} 5. f3 (5. Nf3
