{The Vienna Opening belongs to Open games, where control over the 'a2-g8',
'a3-f8' and 'h5-e8' diagonals is essential for White. As in Open games (1.e4
e5), in the Vienna White's basic goals are: (i) To control the 'd5' square; 
(ii) To play f4 at the appropriate time, in order to open up the 'f' file and
launch a direct attack; (iii) To play Na4 and eliminate Black's dark-squared
bishop. Sometimes White plays f4-f5 to gain more space and to limit Black's
light-squared bishop in active play. White's ideal piece placement in the
Vienna is Bc4,Nc3,d3, Nf3/Ne2, 0-0, f4,fxe5/ f5 etc...} 1. e4 e5 2. Bc4 $1 {

aiming for f3,Bf2,Ne2 and d4... but, in the presence of Black's dark-squared
bishop, his plan is impossible...} Bb6 8. Nxb6 axb6 9. f3 {With continuation
to his normal plan to lead an active game.}) 5. f4 $5 {Choice of many strong
GMs... sharp in nature...} Ng4 $5 {Tempting and popular at club level...} (5...

Thematic Vienna manoeuvre... opening the c1-h6 diagonal and provoking Black

Black...} 8. Qh6 $40 {Preparing Bg5/Qg7 with a crushing attack...}) 3. d3 Nc6

every move... Black has not counterplay at all!} b6 15. Ba3 {A thematic Vienna
piece manoeuvre in the f4-f5 pawn setup... the dark-squared bishop can show
its strength to maximum effect along the 'a3-f8' diagonal rather than c1-h6...}

rank for his rook to penetrate along the h-file...} Rad8 {Black is simply
having to wait, as there is nothing he can to do in this position...} 17. Rae1
{Eyeing the 'h3' square followed by Qh4 and thus forcing Black to play one of
his king side pawns to weaken his king position even further...} Rg8 18. Re3
$40 {Maintaining increasing pressure on Black's camp... White is carrying out
his plan with every move against Black's stalemate king!! White is clearly
better - his plan is Rh3,Qh4.} *
