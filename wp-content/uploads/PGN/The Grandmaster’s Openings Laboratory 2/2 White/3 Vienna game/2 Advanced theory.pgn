{The Vienna Opening is just one in the class of 'open' games. In open games,
control over the 'a2-g8', 'a3-f8' and 'h5-e8' diagonals is very necessary for
White. Attacks against f7 is always a major factor. The basic ideas in Vienna
for White are: 1) to control the 'd5' square. This prevents Black from playing
d5 and, in some lines, allows White to fix his knight on d5.2) to play f4 at
the appropriate time and open up the 'f' file to carry an attack against
Black's weak f7/f6 squares. 3) sometimes White plays f4-f5 (without taking on
e5) and thus gains more space on the king side - at the same time limiting
Black's light-squared bishop. 4) To play Na4 and capture Black's dark-squared
bishop when Black plays Bc5 followed by d6 without playing a6.5) White's ideal
piece placement in the Vienna is Bc4, Nc3, d3, Nf3/Ne2, 0-0, f4, fxe5/f5...} 1.
e4 e5 2. Bc4 $1 {Important move order. In this way, White reaches the Vienna
game while eliminating one powerful option for Black. Usually White plays the
Vienna starting from 2.Nc3. However, in this case Black has a good way to
equalise the game:} (2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Bc4 Nxe4 $1 4. Qh5 (4. Nxe4 d5 $11 {
Regaining a piece!}) 4... Nd6 5. Qxe5+ Qe7 6. Qxe7+ Bxe7 {With a drawish
endgame...}) 2... Nf6 (2... Nc6 $5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. d3 Bb4 {Transposes to the
main line..} (4... Na5 $5 {Transposes to the main line with 4...Na5 variation.}
)) (2... Bc5 $5 {Popular choice...} 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. d3 {White starts with the
normal Vienna setup...} d6 (4... Nc6 5. Bg5 $5 {A practical choice, pinning
the knight and preparing Nd5, thereby increasing pressure on Black's camp...}
h6 $5 {Perhaps Black's best choice... to keep an option to play ..g5 after
White's tempting Nd5 is necessary... if Black ignores White's plan with...} (
5... d6 $5 6. Nd5 Be6 7. Bxf6 $5 {Better than Nxf6 because now White is
maintaining control over the d5 square, which is one of the basic goals of
White in the Vienna... now White has just destroyed Black's pawn structure.}
gxf6 8. c3 {Controlling d4 and preparing b4, thus making space on the queen
side with tempo.} Bxd5 (8... Na5 $6 {This move only helps White in terms of
gaining the initiative...} 9. b4 Nxc4 10. bxc5 $36 {Back's knight is not in an
ideal position...}) 9. Bxd5 Ne7 $5 {Tricky... Black offers the b7 pawn to get
some play in the position...} (9... O-O $6 10. Qg4+ Kh8 11. Qf3 Qe7 12. Ne2 Rg8
13. Ng3 $16 {White's knight finds a very nice outpost from where it can
monitor Black's weaknesses and increase the pressure on the Black's camp.}) 10.
Bb3 {Keeping the bishop till he gains a visible edge is smarter...} d5 {Black
tries to occupy the d5 square - a basic goal in the Vienna - after getting the
chance for the first time in the game...} 11. Qf3 {Attacking the weak f6 and
preparing 0-0-0...} Qd6 {Same idea from Black's perspective... defending f6
and preparing for 0-0-0.} 12. Ne2 Rg8 13. O-O-O O-O-O 14. exd5 Nxd5 15. d4 $40
{Opening the d-file will be dangerous for Black...}) 6. Bh4 $5 {White has
every right to keep the bishop along the h4-e8 diagonal till his control over
the h5 square is asserted, so that Black can't play ..Nh5 after ..g5, thus
eliminating White's key piece - the attacking bishop in this position.} d6 7.
Na4 {Necessary... White is planning to play f3,Bf2,Ne2 and d4... but, in the
presence of Black's dark-squared bishop, this plan is impossible.} Bb6 8. Nxb6
axb6 9. f3 Be6 (9... Na5 $5 10. Ne2 Nxc4 11. dxc4 {White's domination over d5
is visible...}) 10. Ne2 g5 11. Bf2 {With the idea of Bxe6, d4, 0-0, etc.,...
White has an active game.}) 5. f4 $5 {The choice of Nigel Short, John Emm and
other strong player. A practical choice, very sharp in nature... Black will be
outplayed quickly if he proceeds without home preparation. Even if Black
prepares the line, White is still ok.} (5. Na4 $5 {Thematic attack on Black's
dark-squared bishop after Black's ..e6 and without ..a6.} Bb6 {Most popular
response...} (5... Bd4 $5 6. Nf3 $5 (6. c3 $2 {A common mistake at club level
without knowing Black's hidden tactical resources...} Bxf2+ $1 7. Kxf2 c6 $36 {
After ..b5 Black regains his piece with an easier game to play... in contrast,
White has to manage the sheltering of his king, which prevents him from
adopting his normal plan...}) 6... c6 7. Nc3 b5 8. Bb3 Bb6 (8... a5 {A
tempting move...} 9. a4 $5 b4 10. Nxd4 exd4 11. Ne2 $14 {And White gets an
ideal Vienna setup...}) 9. a4 b4 10. Ne2 Nbd7 11. O-O O-O 12. Ng3 Nc5 13. Ba2
$13 {Though the position is quite unclear, White gets an ideal and familiar
Vienna position... his next plan is h3, Be3 and Qd2, etc.}) 6. Nxb6 axb6 7. f4
{Another important piece placement in the Vienna that you should know: usually
when Black plays d6 in such a position, White shouldn't play Ne2 as his knight
has been restricted from the important d4-f4 squares with limited activity;
rather, White should play his king's knight to f3! That is why White now plays
'f4' first.} Nc6 (7... exf4 $5 8. Bxf4 Be6 9. Bxe6 fxe6 10. Nf3 O-O 11. Qd2 Nc6

attack...}) 11. gxf3 dxe5 12. f4 exf4 (12... b5 $2 13. Bxf7+ Kxf7 14. fxe5 $16)

position...f7/f6 have become good targets for White!}) 5... Ng4 $5 {Very, very
tempting... almost 99% of players use this at club level...} (5... c6 $5 {The
critical test in the variation...} 6. Nf3 $5 b5 7. Bb3 O-O 8. fxe5 dxe5 9. Qe2

White as in the main line...}) 7. Bb5 $5 {The choice of Nigel Short, pinning
the knight and preventing Nd4 is necessary...} (7. h3 $5 {Truly a practical
choice, although logically not 100% correct...} Bxf3 8. Qxf3 Nd4 9. Qg3 {White
offers material to gain activity in return... this variation is just a matter
of taste...} Nxc2+ 10. Kd1 Nh5 (10... Nxa1 $6 11. Qxg7 $132) 11. Qg4 Nxa1 12.

chances...}) 6. f5 $1 {Thematic Vienna manoeuvre in a different position...
opening the c1-h6 diagonal, again closing the c8 bishop thus attacking the
knight on g4 and thereby provoking Black to play ..Nf2.} Nf2 7. Qh5 {Aiming
for Qxf7 and mate; thus White uses his hidden resources after sacrificing his
rook...} g6 $5 {Best alternative for Black...} (7... Qd7 $4 8. Be6 $18) (7...

party in time...} Qe3+ 16. Kf1 Qf4+ 17. Kg1 {Check is over... now it's time
for Black to defend...} bxc6 18. Nf6+ Ke7 19. Nxh7 $18 {And Black has no
defence... his queen side pieces are in a starting position.}) 13. d6 $1 {
Controlling the 'e7' square, so that Black can't play Qe7 after White's Qe5+...
again, White is attacking without giving Black any time to defend his position
against him...} bxc4 $8 14. Qxe5+ Be6 (14... Kd7 15. Nge4 $40) 15. Nxf7 $1 {

his piece (by Rxh1) and this leads to a favourable endgame...}) 3. d3 {Here
you can see why White played 2.Bc4 (instead of 2.Nc3); now White can play 3.d3
and Black can't take the e4-pawn (with Ne4) any more...} Nc6 4. Nc3 Bb4 (4...
Na5 {Thematic attack for Black...} 5. Nge2 $1 {Good example of the 'ignoring'
idea, not wasting time by playing the tempting Bb3... now White is happy after
NxBc4, which allows him to control d5 permanently, thus achieving a basic goal
of the Vienna!} Nxc4 (5... c6 $5 6. O-O $5 {Our recommendation... solid and
maintaining the opening principle...} (6. a4 {Is recommended by many DVDs of

attacking position; on the other hand, Black is in a very difficult position

formation.... the basic idea behind this strange-looking f5 move is: (i) to
create space on the king side, thereby limiting Black's play there; (ii)

force Black into taking some critical decisions...} (10. Be3 $5 Re8 11. f5 e4
