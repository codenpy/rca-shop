{The Najdorf Variation of the Sicilian is actually the most popular defence.
So it is very important go deep into this line. As in my previous opening
course "The Grandmaster's Openings Laboratory", I suggest the line starting
with 6. Bg5 castling on the queen side later. In this new course what I do is
add new and better ideas, and dig more into the old lines I gave. Before start
seeing the theory in practice, you should remember that in this line White
should not be afraid of sacrificing material. If you keep this in mind, you're
going to be repaid with a lot of points. Active play is very important in this
line: if you play passively, Black can get an equal position very easily.} 1.
e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 {I think I should talk a
little bit about this move. Because even if we were not going to play the
Najdorf as Black, it is necessary to know what we are facing. a6 has 2 main
ideas: 1. After a6 Black is threating e5. Because the a6 move prevents an
uncomfortable check on b5, for example if Black plays 5...e5 directly 6.Bb5+
and Black has no comfortable way of protecting the check. 6...Bd7 exchanges a
very important piece in this particular pawn structure. and 6...Nbd7 is faced
with 7.Nf5.2. Prepares b5, one of the most typical moves in the Sicilian.} 6.
Bg5 {Develops the bishop to the most active square, prepares castling on queen
side and now 6... e5 is not so strong.} e6 (6... Nbd7 7. Bc4 {This move makes
Black's development a very difficult task.} Qa5 (7... e6 8. O-O {This is one
of the positions where, I think, castling on king side is better, because
Black is facing a lot of problems in developing his pieces. So White does not
need to take any risks.} Qa5 (8... Be7 $2 9. Bxe6 {Is one of White's typical
themes: a piece for three pawns and a better king situation.} fxe6 10. Nxe6 Qb6
11. Nxg7+ Kf7 12. Nf5 $40) 9. Qd2 {And White has all his pieces already
developed, while Black needs to move both bishops and perform the castling.
White can take advantage of his development advantage and attack with f4 and
then prepare e5 or f5, depending on the situation of the pieces.} Be7 10. Rad1
h6 11. Bh4 Ne5 12. Bb3 Bd7 (12... Nxe4 13. Nxe4 Qxd2 14. Rxd2 Bxh4 15. f4 Nc6
16. Nxc6 bxc6 17. Nxd6+ {With a better endgame for White. If you have already
studied the course "Endgame Expert", you may not have problems in winning this
endgame :)}) 13. f4 Nc6 14. f5 {White already implementing his plan, while
Black has not yet castled.}) (7... Qb6 8. Bb3 e6 9. O-O Be7 10. Kh1 {If White
wants to play f4, he needs to remove the king from the a7-g1 diagonal.} Nc5 11.
Qe2 {With the same plan f4 and then playing e5 or f5, depending on the
situation of the pieces.}) 8. Qd2 e6 9. O-O {Transpose to the 7...e6 variation.
And you already know that White's better here.}) (6... e5 $6 {Is not a
suitable move against 6.Bg5 or 6.Bc4. Because the ideal position for the
dark-squared bishop in this pawn structure is g5.} 7. Nf5 {Maximum activity.
After this move Black has a lot of problems; the knight on f5 is like a
pineapple under the arm. And if Black takes it with 7...Bxf5 he is losing his
most important minor piece. Also White is up in development.} Bxf5 8. exf5 Be7
9. Bxf6 {Exchanging a defender of the light squares e4 and d5; after this move
White has a slight but permanent positional advantage. He should put his
bishop on g2 and then castle king side and put pressure on Black's weaknesses.}
Bxf6 10. g3 Nc6 11. Bg2 O-O 12. O-O) 7. f4 {This move doesn't develop a piece
and you may say: "This move is breaking opening principles" - but in this case
this isn't true. Control of the centre is one of the opening principles. Also
this move is going to be necessary at some point. Because, as you have already
seen, White's main plan is to play e5 or f5.} Be7 (7... Qb6 8. Nb3 Be7 9. Qf3
Nbd7 10. O-O-O O-O 11. g4 $1 {In our previous course we suggest the move 11.
Bd3. But in this kind of position, with castling on opposite sides, the rule
is "kill or be killed". And the move 11.Bd3 is certainly not a bad one, but 11.
g4 is more in accordance with the plan.}) (7... Nc6 8. Nxc6 bxc6 9. e5 h6 10.

better endgame for White.}) (7... Nbd7 8. Qf3 Qc7 9. O-O-O b5 10. Bd3 Bb7 11.
Rhe1 {And the ideas are similar to the main line.}) (7... Qc7 8. Bxf6 gxf6 9.
Qd2 Nc6 10. O-O-O Bd7 11. Kb1 $1 {This move is always useful in the position
of queen side castling, especially in the Sicilian because you have removed
the king from the semi-open "c" file.} O-O-O 12. Bc4 {White should have made
this move just after Black castles on the queen side, because if White plays
it a move earlier, Black can start an attack on the queen side with b5-b4 and
a5-a4.} Kb8 13. Nxc6+ Qxc6 14. Bb3 {And White's plan is to play f5 and to put
pressure on the e6 and f6 pawns, using the a2-g8 diagonal and the "f" file.}) (
7... h6 8. Bh4 Qb6 {The idea of this variation with Black is that White cannot
play 9.Nb3 now like in the 7...Qb6 line, because of 9...Qe3+ winning a pawn.
So White should look for another way of protecting his b2 pawn.} 9. a3 $1 {
Setting a beautiful trap} Nc6 (9... Qxb2 $4 10. Na4 $1 {And Black's queen is
trapped!}) (9... Be7 10. Bf2 Qc7 11. Qf3 b5 12. O-O-O {With the same plans g4,
h4 and then, at the appropriate moment, g5.}) 10. Bf2 Qc7 11. Qf3 Be7 12. O-O-O
{And White's plan is to play g4, h4 and, at some point, g5 to open up the king
side.}) 8. Qf3 Qc7 (8... h6 9. Bh4 g5 {This variation has a curious history.
It was first played by Argentinian GM Hernan Pilnik in 1955 against GM
Olafsson. Then in the interzonal of Gothenburg the same year, an interesting
situation occurred. Three Russian players, GM Efim Geller, GM Boris Spassky
and GM Paul Keres, played against three Argentinian players, GM Oscar Panno,
GM Hernan Pilnik and GM Miguel Najdorf. Geller vs. Panno, Spassky vs. Pilnik
and Keres vs. Najdorf. At an important moment, I'm going to finish the story.}
10. fxg5 Nfd7 {The three Russian players reached this position. So what did
Keres and Spassky do? They stood up and left Geller thinking. I cannot stop
laughing when I imagine this situation. Geller calculated all the variations
and played on.} 11. Nxe6 $1 {Then Spassky and Keres sat down and just copied
the move :) !} fxe6 12. Qh5+ Kf8 {Again Spassky and Keres stood up and Geller
played.} 13. Bb5 $3 {Great move! It's just that Fischer, many years later,
discovered a defence. The idea behind this move is the following: White wants
to give checkmate on f7. If Black defends by putting his knight on e5, then
White can renew the threat by playing Bg3. If White's light-squared bishop was
moved on to any other square, Back can defend the e5 knight with his other
knight, thereby holding the position. But in this case, if Black connects the
knights, then the bishop can take one of them! Sometimes I think that this
move was prepared and that all I spoke to you about above was just a
performance! Anyway we will never know the truth.} Rh7 $1 {None of the
Argentinian players made this move and they all lost their respective games. I
think two of them played 13...Kg7 that also holds the position and the other
13.. .Ne5. But in the end they all lost.} (13... Kg7 {Is also playable.} 14.

White can simply start pushing his king side pawns. And you should keep in
mind the rule "Kill or be killed". But in this kind of position White's attack
is faster.}) 10. Bd3 b5 (10... h6 11. h4 $1 (11. Bh4 g5 12. fxg5 Ne5 13. Qe2

and then put pressure on the f6 knight, finally taking it, recovering the
material with a much better position in a number of ways.}) (17... Bf8 18. Bc4

is pretty simple: with a careful manoeuvre, treble up the heavy pieces on the
"e" file creating unavoidable mate threats.}) 18. Bf5 {Cutting off the enemy
king from the c8 square! Black has certainly very few things he can do.
White's plan is to use the "e" file to penetrate into Black's territory.} *
