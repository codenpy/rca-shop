course, is not the idea. Now you have the possibility of playing the theory

This game is so simple because this line is not the best for Black. So White
doesn't need to do much to get a winning position - just to be careful about
Black's resources.} Bb7 20. Bg3 Rd8 21. cxd4 exd4 22. Bd3 Rd5 23. Qe2 h5 24.

highlight games of all the variations with instructive middlegame plans. You
need to put in practice each plan by playing a lot of games using this. The
Najdorf is, without any doubt, one of the most important lines that you should
know very well.} 1-0
