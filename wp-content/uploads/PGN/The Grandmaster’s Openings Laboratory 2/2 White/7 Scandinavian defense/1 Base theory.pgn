1. e4 d5 {This is the Scandinavian Defence. It was not popular, ever, because
after the simple move...} 2. exd5 {Black has to take a difficult decision: (a)
take with the queen and allow White to win some tempos; or (b) play 2...Nf6,
trying to retake with the knight - this also gives White a lot of time to
organise a great position.} Qxd5 (2... Nf6 3. c4 $5 {The idea of this move is
to transpose to the Panov-Botvinik Attack in the Caro Kann Defence. Here Black
has two main options - 3...c6 or 3...e6.} c6 (3... e6 {The idea is to avoid
the Panov-Botvinik. You can find a comprehensive analysis of this "Icelandic
Gambit" in the opening repertoire for Black.} 4. dxe6 Bxe6 5. Nf3 Nc6 (5... Qe7
$5 6. Qe2 Nc6 7. d4 Bg4 8. Be3 {These lines are analysed in the section
"Icelandic Gambit" for the Black pieces.}) 6. Be2 Bc5 7. O-O Qd7 8. Nc3 {And
white is a pawn up. Of course, Black has activity in compensation. Maybe there
is a slight advantage for White.} O-O-O 9. a3 Nd4 10. Nxd4 Bxd4) 4. d4 cxd5 {
And the Panov-Botvinik is reached.}) 3. Nc3 Qa5 (3... Qd6 {Is the main
alternative to Qa5; used by Tiviakov.} 4. d4 Nf6 5. Nf3 {Now Black has two
choices...} a6 (5... c6 6. Ne5 Nbd7 7. Nc4 $1 {Avoiding exchanges and
attacking!} Qc7 8. Qf3 {Preparing Bf4!} Nb6 9. Bf4 Qd8 10. Be5 $1 {Defending
d4 and putting the bishop in an excellent place. Obviously 0-0-0 doesn't work
because of Bg4!}) 6. g3 {This move is not just to dispute the a8-h1 diagonal.
Moreover, with this move White wants to play Bf4 at the right moment.} b5 7.
Bg2 Bb7 8. O-O e6 9. Bf4 {Finally...} Qb6 10. a4 {Threatening a5 and, at the
same time, trying to open the position and take advantage of his better
development.}) 4. d4 Nf6 5. Nf3 c6 (5... Bg4 6. h3 {Attacking the most active
piece of our opponent.} Bh5 7. g4 $1 {In this position, White is not going to
castle on the king side. That's why this move is perfectly possible and even a
very strong one.} Bg6 8. Ne5 {Putting the knight in an excellent location and
threatening h4.} e6 (8... c6 9. h4 Be4 (9... Nbd7 10. Nc4 $1 {White has space
advantage, so it's very logical to avoid exchanges and win a tempo.} Qc7 11. h5
$1 {Winning the bishop pair.} Be4 12. Nxe4 Nxe4 13. Qf3 {Winning a tempo and
preparing Bf4!} Nd6 14. Bf4) 10. Nc4 $1 {Attacking the queen and unpinning the
c3 knight.} Qc7 11. Nxe4 Nxe4 12. Qf3 $1 {With the bishop pair and a very
active position.}) 9. Bg2 {Threatening Bxb7.} c6 10. h4 {Annoying the bishop.}
Be4 {Otherwise White plays Bd2 first and Black never has the option of this
move.} 11. Bxe4 Nxe4 12. Qf3 $1 {Double attack.} Nd6 13. Bd2 {With advantage
for White due to his better development and more active pieces.}) (5... Bf5 6.
Ne5 Nbd7 $2 (6... c6 7. Nc4 Qc7 8. g3 {Following with Bg2 and Bf4 - with a
good position.}) 7. Nc4 $1 {And Black's queen is in trouble!}) 6. Ne5 Be6 7.
Nc4 Bxc4 (7... Qc7 8. Qf3 {Preparing Bf4.} Bg4 9. Qg3 Qxg3 10. hxg3 {This
endgame is slightly better for White, due to the space advantage and the open
'h' file. The doubled pawns are not really weak.}) (7... Qd8 8. Bf4 {With
superior development and space advantage.} g6) 8. Bxc4 e6 9. Qe2 {Keeping the
c1 bishop flexible. And against Bd2, Qb6 is not bad for Black. It's not
necessary for White to sacrifice any material.} Nbd7 10. Bd2 {Now it's time to
develop.} Bb4 11. O-O O-O 12. a3 {And White is going to get the remaining
Black bishop. Besides, White has space advantage. The Scandinavian is really
easy to handle. We should not become relaxed against it. But with good play,
White should gain some advantage.} *
