1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Nf6 3. c4 e6 $5 {A sacrifice for development; this is an
Icelandic gambit. You can find the correct lines for Black in the opening
repertoire for Black.} 4. dxe6 Bxe6 5. Nf3 {Developing the knight to its best
position.} Nc6 6. Be2 {Developing the bishop and preparing 0-0.} Bc5 7. O-O Qd7
{Here White has a few interesting possibilities.} 8. Nc3 {Developing the
knight to its best position.} (8. d3 {following with Nbd2 and Nb3 is an
interesting option. White wants to push back Black's c5-bishop and get control
over the d4-square.}) (8. b4 $1 {A bold decision. White gives back his extra
pawn in order to fight for the initiative. This deflects one of Black's pieces
from the d4-square, allowing White to expand in the center.} Bxb4 9. d4 {
Threatening d5, and all Black's pieces became vulnerable suddenly.}) 8... O-O-O
9. a3 {Preparing b4, which is the main plan here due to the opposite wing
castling.} Nd4 10. Nxd4 Bxd4 11. Nb5 $1 {Threatening Nxd4 - winning the bishop
pair.} a6 12. Nxd4 Qxd4 13. d3 Bf5 14. Qb3 {Preventing Bxd3 due to Rd1 - and,
at the same time, threatening Be3!} Rhe8 15. Bf3 {Threatening on b7 and
removing the threat on e2.} (15. Be3 {Isn't very good after...} Rxe3 16. fxe3
Qxe3+ 17. Kh1 (17. Rf2 Ne4 $1 {And the 'd' pawn is pinned.}) 17... Qxe2 18.
Rxf5 Ng4 19. d4 Ne3 20. Rg5 g6 $44) 15... c6 16. Be3 $1 {Now Black gets his
pawn back. But White has the bishop pair and Black's castled position is in
danger.} Qxd3 17. Qb6 $1 {Taking advantage of this weak square.} Qd6 18. Rad1
Qc7 19. Rxd8+ Rxd8 20. Qb4 $14 {White earns a slight positional advantage and,
most importantly, a very easy to play position. Black has nothing he can do.
The rest of the game is instructive but does not concern our main subject.} Re8

1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Qxd5 {The problem with this move is that White can now
develop a piece and, at the same time, win a tempo.} 3. Nc3 Qd6 {Tiviakov's
speciality.} 4. d4 {Winning the centre.} Nf6 5. Nf3 {Developing with maximum
activity.} a6 6. g3 $1 {This move is very useful in this position for two main
reasons: 1. helps White to fight for the h1-a8 diagonal;. 2. prepares Bf4 at
the right time.} b5 7. Bg2 Bb7 8. O-O e6 9. Bf4 $1 {Now it's time to use the
g3 pawn.} Qb6 10. a4 $1 {This move is very strong because it threatens a5 and
also wants to open the position to take advantage of Black's lack of
development.} Bd6 11. Be3 $1 {Excellent move! White doesn't want to exchange
pieces and, moreover, the bishop is creating an 'x-ray attack', preparing d5
at the right time.} b4 12. a5 $1 Qa7 13. d5 $1 {Now it's time!} Bc5 14. dxe6 $1

17. Bxb7 Qxb7 18. Qd3 $1 {It's amazing how Sutovsky understands this position.
He wants to take on e3 with the queen, creating a lot of threats.} bxc3 (18...
Ba7 19. Rfe1 $1) 19. Qxe3 {Now it's all over for Black! The king has no escape.
This game clearly shows the right spirit for attacking the Scandinavian.} Nbd7

attacking the queen. This move is very typical in the Scandinavian.} Qc7 8. Qf3

here - defending and attacking. 0-0-0 was impossible due to Bg4.} Nbd5 11. Nxd5

This endgame is slightly favourable for White due to the more active pieces
and his space advantage.} O-O-O 16. Ne3 {This move is to avoid exchanges.} (16.

position.} Be6 7. Nc4 Bxc4 8. Bxc4 {Now White has the bishop pair and a little
bit of space advantage.} e6 9. Qe2 {Leaving the bishop on c1 for a while; Bd2
is also possible but allows Qb6.} Nbd7 10. Bd2 Bb4 11. O-O {There is no need
in this position to take the risk of queen side castling - White has a solid
positional advantage.} O-O 12. a3 $1 Bxc3 13. Bxc3 {Two bishops are, in most
situations, superior to two knights.} Qc7 14. g3 {This move is always useful,

White is not going to perform king side castling. That's why this move is not
