1. e4 d5 {This is the Scandinavian Defence. Black's idea is to play a
Caro-Kann structure. Without allowing some variations like the Advance
variation (with e5, which is a weak move here), of course this has the
inconvenience of moving the queen very quickly.} 2. exd5 {A very logical move,
forcing Black to move the queen or to play 2...Nf6, which allows 3.c4.} Qxd5 (
2... Nf6 3. c4 {Defending d5.} c6 (3... e6 4. dxe6 {Simply capturing material.}

free up his position.} Qxf3 14. Rg1) 6. Be2 {Developing and preparing to
castle king side.} Bc5 7. O-O Qd7 8. Nc3 {A natural move...} (8. b4 $1 {Is
probably the most powerful. White is ready to return his extra pawn for
gaining initiative.} Bd4 (8... Bxb4 9. d4 $40 {Threatening d5.}) 9. Nc3 O-O 10.
Bb2 $14) 8... O-O-O 9. a3 {Preparing b4.} Nd4 10. Nxd4 Bxd4 11. d3 {And White
is ok - probably slightly better.}) 4. d4 cxd5 {Transposing to the Panov
attack of the Caro-Kann.}) 3. Nc3 {Very logical, developing and attacking.} Qa5
{The main alternative to this move is Qd6, but Black can also play Qd8 and Qe5.
} (3... Qe5+ {This is a secondary line. White gets a lot of advantage in
development.} 4. Be2 Bg4 (4... c6 5. Nf3 Qc7 6. d4 {And White is better: three
pieces developed, while Black only has the queen developed.}) 5. d4 Bxe2 6.
Ngxe2 Qh5 7. Bf4 {And White has three pieces outside, while for Black it's
only the queen.}) (3... Qd6 {Tiviakov's favourite move.} 4. d4 {Controlling
the centre and preparing development of the queen side bishop.} Nf6 5. Nf3 {
Developing and maximum activity.} c6 {This is the move Tiviakov usually makes.}
(5... a6 6. g3 $1 {Very logical move: the bishop will be excellently placed at
g2 and, at the same time, prepares Bf4 at some point.} b5 (6... Bg4 {A move
with the idea of playing actively - Nc6, 0-0-0.} 7. Bg2 Nc6 8. O-O O-O-O {Both
sides simply finish their development; now White has to create something
against the threat on d4.} 9. d5 $1 Nb4 {Attacking the weak 'd' pawn.} (9...

Unpinning the knight.} Nbxd5 $1 {Only move if...} (13... Bg6 14. Nd4 {And the
queen is in big trouble!}) 14. Nxd5 Rxd5 15. Bd2 Rxd2 16. Nxd2 $16) 7. Bg2 Bb7

threatening a5!} Bd6 11. Be3 $1 {Avoiding exchanges and creating extra
problems related to the d5 break.}) 6. Ne5 {With the idea of playing Bf4 and
creating problems for the queen on d6.} Nbd7 7. Nc4 {Avoiding the exchange of
pieces and attacking the queen.} Qc7 8. Qf3 {Preparing Bf4.} Nb6 9. Bf4 Qd8 10.
Be5 {Defending d4 and putting the bishop on an excellent square; of course,
0-0-0 doesn't work because of Bg4 - winning the exchange.} Bg4 11. Qg3 h5 12.
h3 h4 13. Qf4 Be6 14. Nxb6 Qxb6 (14... axb6 15. Bd3 {With superior development
and a better pawn structure for White.}) 15. O-O-O {With good possibilities
for White. Right now, White is threatening Bc7 and has the better development.}
) (3... Qd8 {This move, the queen going back, isn't a problem for White.} 4. d4
g6 5. Bf4 {Developing the queen side first to get an attacking position.} Bg7

the centre.} Nf6 (4... e5 5. Nf3 {Is advantage to White.}) 5. Nf3 {Maximum
activity and least active piece.} c6 (5... Bg4 6. h3 {Attacking the bishop.}
Bh5 7. g4 {White is weakening the king side just because he wants to attack on
that side.} Bg6 8. Ne5 {Improving the position of the knight and, at the same,
preparing h4.} c6 (8... e6 9. Bg2 c6 10. h4 Be4 11. Bxe4 Nxe4 12. Qf3 Nd6 13.
Bd2) 9. h4 {Now Black has two main possibilities. Until here it's all very
forced after Bg4.} Nbd7 (9... Be4 10. Nc4 {Attacking the queen and unpinning
the knight on c3.} Qc7 11. Nxe4 Nxe4 12. Qf3 {Attacking the e4 knight and
preparing Bf4.} Nf6 13. Bf4) 10. Nc4 {Attacking the queen and trying to unpin
the c3 knight to win the couple of bishops.} Qc7 11. h5 Be4 12. Nxe4 Nxe4 13.
Qf3 {Attacking the e4 knight and preparing Bf4.} Nd6 (13... Nef6 14. Bf4 $16)
14. Bf4 $16) (5... Nc6 {A very secondary line, very easy to play with White.}
6. Bd2 Bg4 7. Nb5 Qb6 8. c4 Bxf3 9. Qxf3 Nxd4 10. Nxd4 Qxd4 11. Qxb7 {And
White has a clear advantage.}) (5... Bf5 6. Ne5 {This move is very typical. As
you saw in past variations, the idea is to put the knight on the excellent e5
square. Also prepare g4 and sometimes this knight goes to c4 attacking the
queen.} c6 (6... Nbd7 $2 7. Nc4 $1 Qa6 {The only move; now Black is lost.} 8.
Bf4 Qe6+ 9. Ne3 Bg4 10. f3 Bh5 11. d5 Qb6 12. Nc4 {And the queen is trapped -
this is why c6 is a very necessary move.}) 7. Nc4 Qc7 8. g3 $1 {A typical move
in the Scandinavian, with the idea of developing the bishop via g2 and also of
playing Bf4.} e6 9. Bf4 Qd8 10. Bg2 {And White's position is more comfortable.}
) 6. Ne5 Be6 (6... Bf5 7. Bc4 {Transposing to a variation we analyse later.})
7. Nc4 {Attacking the queen.} Bxc4 {This move is the most simple for black,
otherwise White gains a comfortable advantage. The bishop isn't really a good
piece on e6.} (7... Qc7 8. Qf3 {Preparing Bf4.} Bg4 9. Qg3 $5 Qxg3 10. hxg3 {
This endgame looks better for White, because of more space and the 'h' file.})
(7... Qd8 8. Bf4 {With a better development and space advantage.}) 8. Bxc4 e6
9. Qe2 {This move is more accurate than Bd2, because it doesn't allow Qb6 -
attacking d4 and b2.} (9. Bd2 Qb6 {And this is probably ok for White after Qe2.
But there is no reason to sacrifice a pawn in this line.}) 9... Nbd7 10. Bd2
Bb4 11. O-O O-O 12. a3 {White is going to get the Black's second bishop and
also enjoys space advantage and no weaknesses. The Scandinavian is a really
simple defence to handle. You should always play actively, trying to get
advantage in space and, most times, with the bishop pair.} *
