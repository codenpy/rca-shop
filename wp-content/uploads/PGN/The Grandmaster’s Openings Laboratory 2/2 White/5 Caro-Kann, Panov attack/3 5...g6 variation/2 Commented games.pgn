Exerting pressure on the d5 pawn. This move is the most popular and the best
in this position. Black should make a decision.} Bg7 (6... dxc4 7. Bxc4 {
Helping White's development.}) (6... e6 {Weakened the dark squares very much.})
7. cxd5 {Taking material. After this, White has two possible plans: 1. Keep
the material; or 2. Return it under favourable conditions.} O-O 8. Be2 {The
idea behind this move is to protect the pawn by playing Bf3. Observe that} (8.
Bc4 {Following the principle of maximum activity doesn't work here because of}
Nbd7 9. Nf3 Nb6 {Attacking the light-squared bishop, a piece that is ultra
important in this variation.}) 8... Nbd7 9. Bf3 {Protecting d5 and preparing
the development of the g1 knight.} Nb6 10. Nge2 Bg4 11. Bxg4 Nxg4 12. a4 {This
move is very important because it works well with White's two main plans. If
Black plays a5, White's normal procedure will be return the pawn under
favourable circumstances. If Black doesn't play a5, White's intention is to
play a5 and keep the extra pawn.} Nf6 {Attacking on d5.} 13. Nf4 {Simply
protecting the material and threatening a5.} (13. a5 Nbxd5 14. Qxb7 {Gives
Black a lot of compensation for the sacrificed pawn.}) 13... a5 14. O-O {
Performing an important opening task.} Qd6 15. Rd1 {Protecting the pawn on d4.
But} (15. Nb5 {Directly was better.} Qd7 16. d6 $1 {If White cannot keep the
material, he should return it under favourable circumstances and this (d6) is
the most typical way to do so. White gets a symmetrical pawn structure with
better piece activity - very similar to what White gets in the game.}) 15...
Rfd8 $6 (15... Rac8 {Its more natural. The rook on d8 will do nothing more
than defend a pawn on d6!}) 16. Nb5 Qd7 17. d6 $1 $14 {You should keep in mind
this important idea! White's returning the material and getting a positional
advantage.} exd6 18. Nc3 $6 {This move isn't the best. We should follow the
principles! 18. Be3, finishing the development, was better.} Ra6 19. Be3 {
Necessary sooner or later. But, as I observed, the previous move for White is
best sooner rather than later. The principle of flexibility - White should
make this move anyway, so why play 18.Nc3?! first?} Rc8 20. h3 (20. Rac1 {Was
slightly more accurate, because at this point this move is more useful than 20.
h3.}) 20... Rc4 21. Nd3 {With a tactical idea in mind.} Qd8 22. Ne5 $5 {Very
interesting tactical idea: taking advantage of Black's dubious coordination
and opening up the position with a lot of threats.} dxe5 23. dxe5 Qe8 {The
best for Black.} (23... Qc8 24. exf6 Rb4 25. Qa3 Nc4 26. Nd5 $1 {This is the
detail that makes Qe8 superior.}) 24. exf6 Rb4 25. Qc2 Bxf6 26. b3 (26. Rac1 $1
{What was White waiting for?}) 26... Qe6 27. Rab1 Ra8 28. Nb5 Rc8 29. Qd3 Rh4
30. Qd2 (30. Qd6 $1 {Maximum activity!}) 30... Rb4 31. Qd3 Rh4 {At this moment
White accepted a draw - maybe not for technical chess reasons. Maybe it was
the situation or the tournament, because in this position White's advantage is
clear, almost decisive, for White has great coordination while Black hasn't.
What we should learn about this game: 1. The two main plans of this variation
and how to explain theoretical moves (12.a4) based on this. 2. The tactical
idea 22.Ne5!? that maybe isn't very typical but is useful to keep in mind. 3.
How White forgot opening principles in the game. You should never forget them!}

pawn is doubled". That's true, but this doubled pawn also controls important
central squares. After you keep your material, your plan should be to use the
strong e5 square with a knight. If Black takes it, recapture with the "e" pawn;
if Black plays f6 at some stage, then White can use the e6 square; and in case
Black lets the knight appear on e5, this piece will create strong pressure on
Black's position.} Nc8 15. O-O Nd6 16. Rd1 (16. Nd3 {Going directly to the
