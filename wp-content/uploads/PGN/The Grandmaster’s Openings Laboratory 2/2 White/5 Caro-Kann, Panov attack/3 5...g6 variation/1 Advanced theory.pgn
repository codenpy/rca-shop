1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3. exd5 cxd5 4. c4 Nf6 5. Nc3 g6 {The idea of this move is
to reach an isolated "d" pawn position with the dark-squared bishop well
placed on g7, creating pressure on d4. The problem with this move is that
White has a way to prevent this situation developing an advantage.} 6. Qb3 $1 {
The principle of keeping the tension. Creating more pressure on d5, White
temporarily wins a pawn, because Black has no good way of defending d5.} Bg7 (
6... e6 {Of course, this moves does not makes sense because: 1. Black's
weakening all the dark squares on the king side. 2. Black's using two
different plans - the one with e6 and the one with g6. So Black's position
isn't good. White can simply develop his pieces following the main opening
tasks, and White is better.}) (6... dxc4 7. Bxc4 {Gives White a lot of
development and a great attacking position.} e6 8. d5 $1 {Opening up the
position directly.} exd5 9. Nxd5 Nxd5 10. Bxd5 {With a clearly better position
for White because of his direct threats and his more active position.}) 7. cxd5
$1 {Taking a central pawn. Now the plans are well defined for the both sides.
For Black: win the d5 pawn, getting the dream isolated "d" pawn position. For
White: sacrifice the "d" pawn on the d6 square, preventing Black from
recapturing with a piece! This way White will get a symmetrical pawn structure
with a better piece placement.} O-O 8. Be2 {The idea of this move is to play
Bf3, defending the d5 pawn momentarily and, at some point after the d6
sacrifice, White's f3 bishop is going to attack b7.} Nbd7 {Black's trying to
realise his plan of attacking d5. The idea of this move is to go with the
knight to b6.} (8... Na6 {The idea is to attack the d5 pawn with Nc7. But this
is a secondary move and is very easy for White to gain advantage.} 9. Bf3 {
Completely natural move, defending the pawn and preparing to develop with Nge2}
Qb6 (9... Nc7 10. Nge2 Rb8 11. Bf4 a6 12. Qb6 $16) 10. Nge2 Qxb3 11. axb3 Nb4
12. O-O Rd8 13. Ra5 $1 {And White has a slight advantage and his plan is to
return the material to get a positional advantage.}) (8... b6 9. Bf3 Bb7 10.
Nge2 Qd7 11. O-O Rd8 12. Nf4 Na6 13. Re1 $14) 9. Bf3 Nb6 (9... Qb6 10. Nge2
Qxb3 11. axb3 Nb6 12. Bf4 $16 {With a very comfortable endgame for White.}) 10.
Nge2 Bg4 (10... Bf5 $5 {Its another option, with the idea of putting the
bishop on d3 and then on c4, recapturing the "d" pawn.} 11. O-O Bd3 12. d6 $1 {
Winning a pawn; of course, Black gets some compensation, but not enough.} exd6
(12... Qxd6 13. Bxb7 Bc4 14. Qc2 Rad8 15. b3 Bxe2 16. Nxe2 Nbd5 17. Bd2) 13.
Bxb7 Rb8 14. Bf3 Nbd5 (14... Re8 15. Re1 Nbd5 16. Qd1 Bc4 {Transpose}) 15. Qd1
Bc4 16. Re1 Re8 17. b3 Bxe2 18. Nxe2 Ne4 19. Bb2 $14 {Black has some
compensation, but White retains a slight advantage. White should try to
activate his pieces.}) 11. Bxg4 Nxg4 12. a4 $1 {Provoking Black into weakening
his position. This move threatens a5, saving the d5 pawn. That's why if Black
wants to recover the material, he is forced to play a5 at some stage. The
inclusion of moves (a4,a5) clearly favours White, because they can take
advantage of Black's new weaknesses (the b5 square and the b7 pawn), while
Black has no way to take advantage of White's weaknesses. Also the b6 knight
becomes a tactical liability.} Nf6 $1 {The best move - the other alternatives
give White an easy advantage.} (12... a5 13. Bf4 $1 Nf6 14. d6 $1 {The typical
move!} exd6 $14 {Now White's position is slightly better, for two reasons: 1.
More active piece placement. 2. Slightly better pawn structure (his weaknesses
are more difficult to attack than Black's).}) (12... Qd7 13. a5 {Of course} Nc8
14. O-O Rd8 15. Re1 {And Black has a big challenge to recover the pawn. White
has the advantage.}) 13. Nf4 a5 {This move is the best chance.} (13... Qd7 14.
a5 Nc8 15. O-O {And again, is very difficult for Black to recover the pawn.})
14. O-O Qd6 {The only move to keep on protecting the b6 knight and prepare an
attack on the d5 pawn. White can use the typical idea of this variation to
gain an advantage.} (14... g5 {Recovers the pawn but weakens the king side
position a lot; this determines White's advantage.} 15. Nd3 h6 16. Bd2 {Simply
finishing the main opening tasks. White has an advantage because Black's
position is very weak.} Nfxd5 17. Nb5 $14 {Using this important square. Now
White's plan is to provoke Black to weaken his position even more with an
eventual f4! or h4!, well prepared of course.}) 15. Nb5 $1 Qd7 16. d6 $1 exd6
17. Be3 $14 {Simply finishing the opening tasks. Now White's plan is to attack
the weak "d" pawn and use his more actives pieces to cramp Black's position.
White should place his rooks on the open files and play calmly, putting
pressure on Black's position. White stands better. So you should remember that
White has two normal ways of getting advantage in this variation: 1. Return
the pawn at the right moment, playing d6 and getting a positional advantage. 2.
Keep the material and get a superior endgame with a pawn up, always keeping in
mind the first way of getting an advantage.} *
