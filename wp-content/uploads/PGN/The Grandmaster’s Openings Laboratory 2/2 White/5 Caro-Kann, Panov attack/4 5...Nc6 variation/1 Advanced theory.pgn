1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3. exd5 cxd5 4. c4 Nf6 5. Nc3 Nc6 {In my opinion, this is
the move that is more in the spirit of the Caro Kann defence, because Black
doesn't close the diagonal of his light-squared bishop. As I have already told
you, developing this bishop is the main idea of the Caro Kann.} 6. Bg5 {
Creating pressure on d5 and forcing Black to make a decision about the type of
game he wants to play. Now Black has seven main alternatives; some of them are
very easy to play with White, so don't get scared!} e6 (6... Be6 $5 {
Developing the bishop defending d5 and putting pressure on c4. The only
disadvantage with this move is that it blocks the "e" pawn.} 7. a3 $1 {
Preparing to play b4 at the appropriate juncture.} (7. Nf3 Ne4 8. Nxe4 dxe4 9.
d5 exf3 10. dxe6 Qa5+ {Leads to a draw after:} 11. Qd2 Qe5+ 12. Qe3 Qa5+ 13.

10. Nf3 Nxg5 11. Nxg5 {With a complicated position.}) 9. c5 {And then White
should attack on the queen side with b4-b5 and c6 eventually.}) (6... dxc4 7.
Bxc4 $5 {Interesting move, sacrificing a pawn for development. Now Black has
four possibilities.} (7. d5 {Is a very good alternative} Ne5 8. Qd4 Nd3+ 9.

Be3 e6 9. Nf3 Bd6 10. O-O {And White has an active position.}) 8. Qxd4 {White
can exchange queens to win tempo in this position. The fact that the queens
are off the board doesn't mean that White hasn't attacking options.} Nxd4 9.
O-O-O $1 {Attacking move} e5 10. f4 {With the idea of opening up the position.}
Bg4 11. Nf3 {Developing!} Nxf3 12. gxf3 Bxf3 13. fxe5 Bxh1 14. exf6 {Black is
an exchange up, but White's activity compensates a lot!} Rc8 15. Re1+ $1 {Its
more accurate because Black has lost the opportunity to castle.} (15. Bd3 {
Isn't the best, for the reason explained.}) 15... Kd7 16. Rd1+ Ke8 17. Bd3 {We
reach the same position, just that right now Black cannot castle.} Rxc3+ {
Black needs to make this move to develop his f8 bishop with check at some
point; but anyway this position is clearly better for White.} 18. bxc3 $16 {
White's clearly better. Black pieces and king are very badly placed.}) (6...
Qa5 7. Nf3 {Simply using the principle of least active piece and maximum
activity.} Bg4 8. Bxf6 exf6 9. h3 Bxf3 10. Qxf3 dxc4 11. Qe3+ Be7 12. Bxc4 O-O
13. O-O Rad8 14. Rad1 {And White has a slightly preferable position due to the
pawn structure. Of course, the presence of opposite coloured bishops gives
Black chances.}) (6... Qb6 7. cxd5 Nxd4 (7... Nxd5 $5 8. Nxd5 Qa5+ 9. Nc3 Qxg5
10. Nf3 Qf4 11. d5 Ne5 12. Bb5+ Bd7 13. Bxd7+ Nxd7 14. O-O $16 {White's
position is clearly better. He has better development, better pawn structure
and his king is safe.}) 8. Nf3 {Simply using the principle of maximum activity
and attacking the opponent's most active piece.} Qxb2 (8... Nxf3+ 9. Qxf3 a6
10. Bd3 {And White is better.}) 9. Rc1 Nxf3+ 10. Qxf3 a6 11. Bd3 h6 12. Bd2 {
And White has a lot of development for the pawn and Black's queen is misplaced.
}) (6... Ne4 7. Nxe4 dxe4 8. d5 {Winning space and, at the same time,
defending the "d" pawn and attacking Black's knight.} Ne5 (8... f6 9. Be3 {
With a slightly better position for White.}) 9. Qd4 Ng4 (9... f6 10. Qxe4 Qb6
11. O-O-O {With advantage in development for White.}) 10. c5 $1 $14 {Winning
more space and threatening check in the a4-e8 diagonal.} e5 11. Bb5+ Bd7 12.
Qa4 $14 {And White is putting the pressure on.}) (6... Bg4 {The most Caro Kann
style move, but certainly not the best.} 7. Qa4 (7. f3 $1 Be6 8. c5 Qd7 9. Bb5)
7... Nd7 (7... e6 8. h3 {Forcing Black to define his bishop.} Bh5 9. cxd5 exd5
10. Bb5 $14 {And we have a symmetrical pawn structure with White's pieces in
more active places.}) 8. c5 (8. Nxd5) 8... f6 9. Be3 {And White's position
seems a little bit better. For example:} e5 10. dxe5 Ncxe5 11. b4 {And White
is fine here.}) 7. c5 {Getting the same structure as in the 5.. .e6 variation.
We already know how to play this structure, so this should be an advantage in
our learning process for this variation.} Be7 (7... Bd7 8. Rb1 {Preparing b4!}

Attacking the c3 knight and the g2 pawn.}) 8... Be7 9. Nf3 O-O 10. Bd3 {One of
the few positions in which the bishop shouldn't go to b5. White has the normal
modest edge in this position after 0-0 and b4.}) 8. Bb5 $1 {Of course, the
knight is already on c6.!} Bd7 9. Nf3 O-O 10. O-O b6 11. Bxc6 Bxc6 12. Ne5 {
Using the principle of an attack.} Rc8 13. b4 Ne4 14. Bxe7 Qxe7 15. Nxe4 dxe4
