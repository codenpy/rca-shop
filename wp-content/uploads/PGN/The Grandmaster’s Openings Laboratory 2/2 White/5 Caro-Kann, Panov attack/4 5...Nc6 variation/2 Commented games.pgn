1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3. exd5 cxd5 4. c4 Nf6 5. Nc3 Nc6 {The most Caro Kann style
move. Because it's the only one that allows Black to develop his light-squared
bishop that is the main idea of the Caro Kann.} 6. Bg5 {Putting pressure on f6
and threatening to win a pawn on d5. Also this move follows the principle of
maximum activity.} dxc4 7. d5 (7. Bxc4 {Sacrificing the "d" pawn for
development is another alternative, and we are going to check it in another
game.}) 7... Ne5 8. Qd4 {Principle of maximum activity and principle of an
attack!} Nd3+ 9. Bxd3 {Only move.} cxd3 10. Nf3 {Now White doesn't hurry to
recover the pawn: is giving preference to following the opening tasks. Black
has the option of defending the pawn - and we should certainly analyse it.} g6
$6 (10... Bf5 {Developing and defending was an important option.} 11. O-O {
Finishing the opening tasks. Now Black should find a way of developing his
pieces, especially on the king side.} e6 {Is the most natural move, but allows}
(11... Qb6 12. Qa4+ Bd7 13. Qd1 {And White has definite compensation because
Black hasn't developed the king side and the d3 pawn is very weak. Taking the
b2 pawn right now is very risky. And Bf5 is faced with Nh4, recovering the
pawn.}) 12. Qa4+ Qd7 13. Nb5 $18 {With a double threat: Nc7 and Ne5.}) 11. Bxf6
exf6 12. O-O Qb6 (12... Be7 {Is the only move Black has, to survive.} 13. Rfe1
O-O 14. Rad1 {And White's better, because he is going to recover the pawn with
a better position (passed pawn, active pieces).}) 13. Rfe1+ Kd8 14. Qh4 {White
threatening 15.Ne5.} (14. Qxd3 {Was more simple.}) 14... g5 15. Qh5 {White has
a clear advantage. The rest was easy for Botvinik.} Bd6 16. Qxf7 Rf8 17. Qxh7

It's very important to know this and to remember it all the time."} 1-0

1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3. exd5 cxd5 4. c4 Nf6 5. Nc3 Nc6 6. Bg5 Be6 7. a3 $1 {A
excellent move, ignoring for a moment the opening tasks. But White needs to
play this move to support b4 in the future, as you are going to see. I'm going
to explain to you how to discover this move using the following understanding:
"Black's last move demonstrates his intentions of castling queen side, because
with Be6 blocking the "e" pawn, that is the natural move for developing the
king side. That's why White prepares an attack on the queen side with the move
a3".} Qd7 8. Be2 (8. Nf3 {Is the most natural move according to the principle
of the least active piece. But it allows.} Ne4 {And after the exchange.} 9.

after} 10. d5 exf3 11. dxe6 Qxe6+ $17) 8... O-O-O 9. c5 {Now White gets queen
side space and you can see how useful the move a3 is going to be in this
position.} Ne4 10. Nf3 {Developing.} Nxg5 11. Nxg5 h6 12. Nf3 g5 {Black should
attack on the king side and develop his pieces, but White's attack comes first.
} 13. b4 g4 14. b5 $1 {An excellent intermediate move.} gxf3 15. bxc6 Qxc6 16.
Bxf3 {White has the advantage and the plan is to push the "c" pawn in some way.
Look how GM Adams treats the rest of the game, in a very simple way.} Bf5 17.

situation.} Qe8 24. c6 $1 Bxb4 25. axb4 Be4 26. f3 Bf5 27. Qa4 Bh3 28. Qxa7

ideal in the opening.} e5 10. f4 {White wants to open the position.} Bg4 11.

position.} Nxf3 12. gxf3 Bxf3 13. fxe5 {Look at White's situation - very

O-O O-O 10. Rc1 {White has a more active position.} a6 11. Bd3 {This is the
typical position for this bishop in Isolated "d" pawn positions. Because
White's plan is to attack on the king side and this square is the best for the
purpose of attacking h7.} Bd7 {Black's finishing his development.} 12. Re1 {
Maximum activity.} Rc8 13. h4 {Typical move. At some point, Black should play
g6. So White prepares to play h5 against g6. Also provides the h2 square for
the king. But maybe this move isn't the most accurate, as it isn't really
necessary to play it right now. Maybe something like 13. Ne5, following the
principle of maximum activity, was better.} Nb4 14. Bb1 {In this kind of
position, this bishop is a very important piece for three reasons: 1. First of
all, White should avoid exchanges because all the endings favour Black. 2.
Controls a lot of important squares (c4,d5,e4). 3. Helps White attack the king
side.} Bc6 15. Ne5 {Following the principle of maximum activity.} g6 16. Qb3 {
Developing the queen and attacking the b4 knight. This move sacrifices the d4
pawn and Black didn't capture it.} Nbd5 (16... Qxd4 $5 17. Rcd1 Qc5 18. Nxc6

isolated "d" pawn.} 1-0
