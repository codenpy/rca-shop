1. e4 c6 {The Caro Kann is a very solid defence. Not the best defence, but a
solid one. Why this move isn't the best? Mainly because it breaks the
principle of maximum activity.} 2. d4 d5 3. exd5 (3. e5 {Is very popular
now-a-days. But usually Black is very well prepared against this move. Also it
allows Black to perform the main idea of the Caro Kann, which is to develop
the light-squared bishop.} Bf5) (3. Nc3 {Enables Black to carry out the main
idea of the Caro Kann with} dxe4 4. Nxe4 Bf5) 3... cxd5 4. c4 $1 {This move is
called the Panov Botvinik attack and the idea is very clear: start putting
pressure on to Black's centre. Black taking on c4 helps a White piece to reach
a good position. If black doesn't take, this move will help White to gain
space with c5 and obtain a queen side majority.} Nf6 5. Nc3 e6 {And you may be
thinking now. Black's playing badly - why doesn't he develop the c8 bishop,
which is the main idea of the Caro Kann?} (5... Bf5 6. Qb3 {A very typical
move in the situations where Black develops the c8 bishop. This is one of the
points in favour of the Panov Botvinik attack. That opposes the main idea of
the Caro Kann. After 6. Qb3 Black loses a pawn, as you can note by yourself :)}
) 6. c5 $5 {In our previous course we suggest the move 6.Nf3 that can
transpose to this line after 6...Be7 7.c5 but gives Black the extra option of
playing 6...Bb4. The idea of this move is quite simple: gain extra space on
the queen side, prevent the creation of a "d" isolated pawn, which isn't bad
but usually Black likes to play against it; limit the activity of the f8
bishop; and gain a queen side majority. That is one of the main themes of this
line - use this majority in a tactical or in a strategic way. Now Black has
five options; we are going to see each one and we will see all the main themes
that white has in this variation.} Be7 {The main line - Black's continuing the
development of the pieces.} (6... Nc6 {Is not so strong for Black, because now
White knows where his f1 bishop is going.} 7. Bb5 $1 {Now White's play is very
easy, while for Black it is really difficult to find counterplay.} Bd7 8. Nf3
Be7 9. O-O O-O 10. Re1 $14 {White's plan is to prevent Black's counterplay 
(not a very difficult task) and, at the appropriate moment, start advancing
his queen side majority.}) (6... b6 7. b4 a5 {Faces with} (7... Be7 8. Nf3 O-O
9. Qc2 {Transposes to the main line.}) 8. Na4 $1 {The typical response.} (8.
Bb5+ $5 {Is an interesting alternative for those players who like complicated
positions.} Bd7 (8... Nbd7 9. Na4 $1) 9. Qa4 {Threatening c6.} Qc8 (9... Qc7
10. Bxd7+ Qxd7 (10... Nbxd7 11. Nb5 $36) 11. Nb5 Nc6 12. Nf3 bxc5 13. bxc5 {
And White has advantage, because of his passed "c" pawn and his active pieces.}
) 10. Nf3 Be7 11. Ne5 Bxb5 12. Qxb5+ Nfd7 13. Na4 {With a very slight
advantage for White.}) 8... bxc5 (8... axb4 9. Nxb6 {White is better, for
obvious reasons.}) (8... Nbd7 9. Bb5 $1 Ba6 {For example} 10. Bxa6 Rxa6 11. b5
Ra8 12. c6 $16) 9. bxc5 {With the typical slight advantage for White.}) (6...
Ne4 7. Qc2 $1 {White's attacking a Black piece on his territory and, at the
same time, is keeping his pawn structure.} f5 (7... Nxc3 8. Qxc3) (7... Nc6 8.
Bb5 {The thematic move.} (8. Nxe4 {Isn't good, because Black gets counterplay
against the d4 pawn.} dxe4 9. Qxe4 Qxd4 $17) 8... Bd7 9. Nf3 Be7 {Gives White
easy play and a move like} (9... Qa5 {Isn't very good for Black} 10. Rb1 Nxc3
11. bxc3 {And Black's queen is misplaced on a5; White has a very good position.
} b6 12. Bd2 $1 bxc5 13. c4 $1 {With initiative for White.}) 10. O-O (10. Nxe4
$2 {Doesn't work here because of} dxe4 11. Qxe4 $2 (11. Bxc6 Bxc6 {Is bad for
White but necessary.}) 11... Qa5+ $1 {Winning the b5 bishop.}) 10... O-O 11.
Bf4) 8. f3 (8. Nf3 {Is more suitable for those who like to play simple
positions. However 8.f3 is more powerful.}) 8... Nxc3 (8... Qh4+ 9. g3 Nxg3 10.
Qf2 $1 f4 $5 11. Nb5 Na6 12. Bxf4 Nf5 13. Qxh4 Nxh4 {With a better endgame for
White because of his more active play.}) 9. Qxc3 Nc6 10. Bb5 $1 Bd7 11. Bxc6
Bxc6 12. Nh3 {White has a slight advantage because of Black's weak "e" pawn.
The plan for White is to attack it using the "e" file and the f4 square for
the knight.}) (6... Bd7 {From here the bishop is controlling very important
squares but has a little problem} 7. Nf3 $1 {The knight is heading to e5
attacking the bishop.} b6 (7... Nc6 8. Bb5 {Transposes to the 6...Nc6 variation
}) 8. b4 Ne4 9. Ne5 $1 Nxc3 10. Qf3 $1 f6 11. Nxd7 Nxd7 12. Qxc3 {With
advantage to White: a bishop pair and a passed "c" pawn.}) 7. Nf3 {Simply
developing the knight to its most active square.} O-O 8. Qc2 $1 {In my opinion
this is the strongest move here. It's time to start understanding this line...
Black's position is cramped and normally he has three ways for looking of
counterplay. 1. play b6 and attack White's pawn chain. 2. play Nc6 trying to
play e5 at some point. 3. play Ne4 at some stage followed by f5 and this
strong knight should give Black counterplay. Now that you already know Black's
counterplay methods, you should take a look at this move and how it decrease
the force of each of Black's ideas.} b6 $5 {The most typical method of looking
for counterplay and probably, in this position, the most effective one.} (8...
Ne4 $2 {Simply lose a pawn.} 9. Nxe4 dxe4 10. Qxe4) (8... Nc6 9. Bb5 $1 {One
of the most important ideas of the variation is to wait for black to play Nc6
and then just develop White's bishop on the b5 square. Now it's very difficult
for Black to prepare e5, so this give White an advantage.} Bd7 10. O-O b6 {
Black should look for some counterplay.} (10... a5 $5 {Preventing b4 from
White.} 11. Be3 b6 12. Qa4 $1 Rc8 13. cxb6 Qxb6 14. Ne5 $14 {White has a more
active position and, if Black doesn't want to lose, the bishop pair should
play.} Be8 15. Rac1 {And Black's position keeps being cramped.}) 11. Bxc6 $1 {
Waiting for the accurate moment to make this exchange.} Bxc6 12. b4 $14) 9. b4
{9.b4 is the normal answer to b6... 9.cxb6 doesn't give Black many problems.}
a5 {If Black doesn't play this, his last move is unjustified. Now it seems
that White has some problems. But in this pawn structure White has a very
important resource that you should always keep in mind.} 10. Na4 $1 {Keeping
the position with even some advantage for White. Black has four main
alternatives.} bxc5 (10... axb4 11. Nxb6 {And White has slight advantage
because of his strong knight on b6 and the passed "c" pawn.}) (10... Nc6 {Is
the worst of Black's logical possibilities; White simply gets advantage with:}
11. b5 Nb4 12. Qb1 bxc5 13. dxc5 {White threatening 14.a3} d4 14. a3 Nbd5 15.
Bd3 {And the evaluation of the position is the following: White has connected
passed pawns on the "c" and "b" files. Black has a majority in the centre. The
thing that gives white a CLEAR advantage is that his passed pawns aren't
blockaded, while Black's centre majority is very easy to control.}) (10... Nbd7
$5 {A very important alternative to the main 10...bxc5.} 11. b5 $1 {Now Black
has two logical alternatives.} bxc5 (11... e5 $5 {Trying to open the position,
taking advantage of the fact that White is behind in development.} 12. Nxe5
bxc5 13. Nc6 $1 Qe8 14. Ba3 {White may be behind in development but Black's
position is very passive and cannot take advantage of his development; White
has the advantage.} Bb7 15. Nxe7+ Qxe7+ 16. Be2) 12. dxc5 $14 {And White's
passed pawns are more valuable than Black's centre majority. That determines
White's advantage. For example:} e5 13. Be2 {And Black can try to advance his
centre pawns, but any of the possibilities work for him.} e4 (13... d4 14. O-O
{And Black cannot keep advancing.}) 14. Nd4 {And Black's centre is well
blockaded.}) 11. bxc5 {Leaves White with a protected passed pawn. Black should
try to play e5 to attack White's pawn structure.} Nc6 12. Be2 {This is one of
the few positions in which White shouldn't play Bb5 against Nc6 - the reason
is that the bishop on b5 isn't very safe because of the open "b" file.} (12.
Bb5 $6 {Of course.} Nb4 13. Qe2 Rb8 $1 {Threatening 14...Rxb5!} 14. Nb6 $1 Rxb6
$1 15. cxb6 Qxb6 16. O-O Ne4 {With a lot of compensation for the sacrifice
exchange.}) 12... Rb8 13. O-O $14 {And I think White is slightly better
because of his passed "c" pawn and should just be careful about the rupture on
e5. The plans for White here can be the following: 1. Transpose into a
favourable endgame. 2. Push the "c" pawn. 3. Use the b6 square to cramp
Black's position even more. Of course, always keeping an eye on the important
e5 square. And, naturally, the c1 bishop should go to f4!} *
