1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3. exd5 cxd5 4. c4 Nf6 5. Nc3 e6 6. c5 Nc6 $6 {Not the most
accurate move. For Black the best plan is to postpone the typical methods for
counterplay which I'm going to repeat: 1. b6 attacking White's pawn chain 2.
Nc6 preparing e5 at a later moment 3. Ne4 If White takes Black's knight,
obtain counterplay against the "d" pawn; if White doesn't take it, this knight
is very well placed and can be supported by f5. And you already know that
White's plan is to prevent all Black's counterplay and, later on, take
advantage of his queen side majority.} 7. Nf3 (7. Bb5 {Maybe was a little more
accurate. Remember White should wait for Black's Nc6 and then answer with Bb5;
this is a general rule of this variation.}) 7... Ne4 8. Qc2 {Keeping the pawn
structure and attacking the knight on e4; this move is a typical response to
Ne4.} f5 {Blacks using a typical method of counterplay in this line; of course,
this has some inconvenience: 1. leaves the e6 pawn backward; 2. now the e5
square can be used.} 9. Bb5 $1 {Of course it was time.} Bd7 10. O-O Be7 11.
Bxc6 Bxc6 12. b4 {Now White has a typical position. Black has a bishop pair v
the queen side majority and the weaknesses on the "e" file. This determines
White's advantage because Black's bishop pair is temporarily very passive.} O-O
13. Bf4 {Controlling the key e5 square.} g5 14. Be5 $1 f4 15. Nd2 (15. b5 $5 {
Prepares an interesting exchange sacrifice.} Be8 16. Nxe4 dxe4 (16... Bg6 $5
17. Nfd2 dxe4 18. Nxe4 f3 19. Rfe1 {With not enough compensation for Black.}
Qd5 20. Rab1 Bxc5 21. Qxc5 Bxe4 22. Qe7 Rf7 23. Qxg5+ $16) 17. Qxe4 Bxb5 18.
Qxb7 Bxf1 19. Rxf1 $16 {With a clear advantage, because of the more active
play and the passed "c" pawn.}) 15... Nxd2 16. Qxd2 f3 17. g4 $1 {With the
plan of Kh1-Rg1 and Rg3 attacking the weak f3 pawn.} Bf6 18. Bd6 Qd7 19. Kh1 {
Prophylactic move against e5.} Qg7 $6 (19... Rf7 $1) 20. Rad1 (20. Bxf8 $1 Rxf8
21. Rad1 {Black hasn't enough compensation.}) 20... Rf7 21. Rg1 h5 $6 {After
this White's advantage is clear; simply, White's won a pawn.} 22. gxh5 Qh6 23.
Be5 $6 {I will never understand why GM Gdanski failed to push his pawn to b5
instead of this move!} (23. b5 $1) 23... Bxe5 $6 24. Qxg5+ Qxg5 25. Rxg5+ {The
rest is very easy.} Kh7 26. Rxe5 Rg8 27. Rxe6 Rg2 28. b5 Rf5 29. Rg6 Rxf2 30.
Kg1 Rc2 31. bxc6 Rxh5 32. Rf6 bxc6 33. Rxf3 Rhxh2 34. Rg3 {In this game you
should learn at least the following: 1. For Black, the start isn't very good,
looking for counterplay without development. 2. The use of the e5 square for
white. 3. White should in general advance his queen side majority as much as
he can. 4. Qc2 as a typical response to Ne4 5. The exchange Bxc6 at the
appropriate moment followed by b4. I said 'at least' because if you were able
to reach a conclusion by your own efforts, that's even better.} 1-0

1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3. exd5 cxd5 4. c4 Nf6 5. Nc3 e6 6. c5 b6 {As I said in the
previous game: it's better to first develop and then look for counterplay. But
this move is certainly better than 6...Nc6?!} 7. b4 a5 8. Na4 $1 {The typical
response against this attempt at counterplay. White keeps his position even
with advantage. Now Black's the side that should think how to keep his
position :) . This move probably has a psychological effect on the player who
doesn't expect it.} bxc5 9. bxc5 {White obtains a protected passer.} Nfd7 10.
Nf3 Be7 11. Bf4 O-O 12. Rc1 {The player who understands this variation
understands all the last moves of both sides. It's a positional battle that
White finally won. In the last three moves Black was postponing Nc6 until
White developed his f1 bishop; and White was postponing the development of the
bishop until Black defined the Knight! Now White is threating c6, so Black
needs to stop it with 12... Nc6 - that's why I said that White won the
positional battle.} Nc6 13. Bb5 $1 {This move is typical because it avoids
Black's counterplay based on e5!} Bb7 14. O-O Bf6 15. Re1 {Controlling even
more the important e5 square.} Rc8 16. Bf1 $5 {An interesting move. White
already has an advantage and this move is a direct attempt for White. An
important thing you should take note of is that the bishop on f4 plays a very
important job, which is to control the b8 square and avoid Black's rook being
placed on the open "b" file. That's why White moves his bishop from this file
to start using it with the heavy pieces.} Ne7 17. Qb3 {White starting to use
the "b" file.} Bc6 18. Nb6 $1 {A typical strategy - look at White's perfect
coordination! The knight on b6 is trapping Black's c8 rook in combination with
the f4 bishop, and if Black exchanges it Whites obtains a "b" passer that,
combined with the f4 bishop, gives him a clear advantage.} Nxb6 19. cxb6 Qd7 {
Black should prevent b7.} 20. Ba6 {Threatening b7.} Bb7 21. Bb5 {Attacking the
queen.} Bc6 (21... Qd8 22. Bc7 $1 {Definitely this bishop deserves a medal of
honour for this game! And in general, it's a very important piece in this
variation.}) 22. Bxc6 Nxc6 23. b7 {Now White's advantage is completely
decisive.} Rcd8 24. Rxc6 Qxc6 25. b8=Q Rxb8 26. Bxb8 a4 27. Qb1 {What we
should learn at least from this game: 1. As we already know, Black's direct
attempts at counterplay aren't very effective. 2. The strategic fight in the
moves 9-12: Black's waiting to play Nc6 for White to define his f1 bishop in a
square different than b5 and finally White won the strategic battle because he
forced Black to play Nc6 first. 3. You should look at Whites Bf1!? and all the
strategy that follows. 4. You should start feeling the strength of the bishop
on f4.5. The importance of the "b" file. 6. How to use the b6 square to create
a more dangerous passer that, combined with the f4 bishop, gives White a
decisive advantage. 7. The tactical motifs of trapping Black's pieces in the
variation - 21...Qd8 22. Bc7! and also after 18.Nb6! Black's rook is trapped;
this gives White a clear-cut advantage because it forces Black to allow the
"b" passer.} 1-0

1. c4 c6 2. e4 d5 3. exd5 cxd5 4. d4 {We reach the position from a different
move order.} Nf6 5. Nc3 e6 6. c5 Be7 $1 {The best move for Black; he wants to
castle first and then look for counterplay.} 7. Nf3 O-O 8. Qc2 $1 {A very
important move. In this particular line, if White prevents all Black's
attempts at counterplay, or at least if not prevent it prepare a good reply
against it, this guarantees a good game for White. You already know what the
typical methods of counterplay are. And the idea of this move is to prevent
Ne4, and prepares good replies to b6 and Nc6.} b6 (8... Nc6 9. Bb5 $1 {Of
course!}) 9. b4 Bb7 $5 {Against a5 White should play 10. Na4! The typical
response!} 10. Rb1 $1 {A very important and typical prophylactic move. After 9.
. .Bb7 Black's threat of 10...a5! gains force. That's why White is PREVENTING
HIS OPPONENT'S COUNTERPLAY! against 10... a5 now White simply has 11.a3!} Nc6
11. Bd3 (11. Bb5 $1 {Is of course more logical. Anyway this game is very
instructive.}) 11... Rc8 12. O-O Ne4 {Sacrificing a pawn in the look for
counterplay. This variation is really funny to play as White, for the
following reason: you are simply waiting and placing your pieces to prevent
your opponent's counterplay, while Black is desperately looking for something
that probably, in the end, doesn't work. You should just wait and see how your
opponent gets on - losing his last breath of active play in the pure style of
Tigran Petrosian :D . In the present game after 12...Ne4 White has clear
advantage.} 13. b5 $1 {A typical move; the idea is not just to create a passer
but also to trap Black's pieces on the queen side.} Nxd4 {A desperate-looking
attempt, but also necessary.} (13... Na5 14. c6 Bxc6 15. bxc6 Rxc6 16. Bd2 $16)
14. Nxd4 Nxc3 15. Bxh7+ $1 {Whites gives back the piece to obtain a decisive
positional advantage WITH NO COUNTERPLAY FOR BLACK!} Kh8 16. Qxc3 Kxh7 17. c6
$1 {The typical idea. Now White's strategy is based on Capablanca's iron
principle: when you trap an opponent's piece on one side of the board, you
should attack on the other side, because on that side you will have a piece
up! So now just look how GM Evgeny Postny gives a masterclass.} Kg8 18. Qh3 Ba8
19. Rb3 Bf6 20. Qg4 Re8 21. Rh3 $1 {Capablanca was a very wise man.} Bxd4 22.
Qxd4 e5 23. Qd3 e4 24. Qd4 Qd6 25. Rh5 Red8 26. Rd1 Bxc6 {What else?} 27. bxc6
Rxc6 28. Bb2 f6 29. Rxd5 Qxd5 30. Qxd5+ Rxd5 31. Rxd5 Rc2 32. Rb5 {What you
should learn at least from this game: 1. The idea of preventing your
opponent's counterplay (8. Qc2; 10. Rb1). 2. The idea of trapping Black's
pieces on the queen side ( 13.b5!; 17. c6!). 3. And finally, how to take
advantage of the fact that Black's pieces, or one Black piece, are trapped on
the queen side - using Capablanca's iron principle.} 1-0

12. O-O Rc8 13. Bf4 {The 'Super Bishop'!} Qa5 14. Bxc6 {A move that sooner or
later White should make anyway.} Bxc6 15. Rab1 {Now it's time to evaluate the
position: Black has bishop pair while White has the open "b" file, a protected
passer, a super bishop on f4 and good squares for his knights, especially e5
that is one typical square for the "f3" knight in this variation.} Rfd8 16. Ne5
$14 {White's advantage is clear.} Be8 {We have a clear positional advantage,
so it's time to create a plan. White should without any doubt make use of his
passer, but one weakness is not enough - White should create another to
stretch Black's defence. So the plan is to attack on the king side and, at the
same time, use the passer.} 17. Bd2 Qa6 18. Bg5 {Pinning the knight. And
tempting Black to weaken his king side.} h6 19. Bh4 Rb8 $6 (19... g5 $1 {Risky,

different move order to reach the same position anyway; I prefer 7.Nf3 because
it's more flexible.} O-O 8. Nf3 b6 9. b4 a5 10. Na4 $1 axb4 11. Nxb6 Ra5 {Now
the first critical position! You may think the following: the knight on b6 is
very strong, so I will never exchange it for the c8 bishop! This is the WRONG
thinking. The knight on b6 is temporarily strong, but in a few moves Black
will reject it or exchange it by playing Bb7 and Nfd7, for example. So it's
better to take advantage of his temporarily active position and get a stable
factor - which is the bishop pair!} 12. Nxc8 $1 (12. Bd3 Ba6 $1 {Even better
than Bb7.} 13. O-O Bxd3 14. Qxd3 Nc6 {No problems for Black here. The b6
knight does nothing.}) 12... Qxc8 13. Bd3 Nc6 14. Bf4 Qb7 15. O-O {The main
opening tasks are finished and it's time to evaluate the position. White first
of all has a bishop pair and a protected passer, and Black has a weak pawn on
b4 while White has a weak pawn on a2. So the plans are determined: each side
should attack the weak pawn of the other side. Of course, White has more
possibilities because of his other advantages.} Rfa8 16. Rfb1 {Logical moves.}

Always be careful about the e5 break. 4. White's slow but precise manoeuvres.
