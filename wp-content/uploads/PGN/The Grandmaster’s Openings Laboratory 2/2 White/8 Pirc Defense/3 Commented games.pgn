1. e4 d6 2. d4 g6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 {One of the most aggressive lines and, at
the same time, very easy to play - and objectively a very good choice!} Bg7 5.
Qd2 {Preparing 0-0-0. Obviously White wants to create a position with chances
to make an attack.} c6 6. f4 {The indirect pressure that the bishop places on
e,7 plus the threat of playing e5, determines White's advantage.} O-O 7. Nf3 {
Developing with maximum activity.} Bg4 {This move is not very accurate - the
bishop is not doing very much on g4; better is d5 or b5.} (7... d5) 8. Bd3 Nbd7

terrible pressure: the two bishops and the d1 rook.} (13. dxc5 {Was probably a
slightly more accurate choice. White's position is better!} Bxf3 14. gxf3 Nxe5
15. Be2 $14) 13... f6 $4 (13... a6 {Was much better - and Black is close to
equality.}) 14. dxc5 $1 {Opening the 'd' file and threatening Qc4+. White has
a decisive advantage.} Kh8 15. exf6 exf6 16. Bf4 a6 17. Ba4 b5 18. cxb6 Rc8 19.

the best choice for Black.}) 7. O-O-O c6 8. f4 {This kind of position is
usually very comfortable for White: centre and good piece activity. While for
black - what?} Na6 {I really don't think that manoeuvring the knight to c7 is
a very good idea.} 9. Nf3 Nc7 10. Bd3 b5 11. f5 $5 {This move is justified
because g6 is weak.} g5 12. Bg3 b4 13. Na4 {13.Ne2 was a more logical choice.}

position from the 4.Bg5 variation, produced after 4...h6 5.Be3,Bg7 6.f3, c6 7.
Qd2, h5.} 7. O-O-O b5 8. Nh3 $1 {Our suggestion is to play this. The idea is
to play Ng5, getting an excellent square. If Black exchanges, like in the game,
there is no problem for White.} Bxh3 (8... O-O {It's another choice.} 9. Ng5 b4
10. Ne2 a5 11. Nf4 {White has got good attacking chances.}) 9. gxh3 {The
problem for Black in this position is that the light squares can become weak
in future, due to lots of pawn moves (b, c, d, g and h). This create a lot of
potential weaknesses.} Qc8 10. e5 $1 {White has the bishop pair and Black has
the king in the centre, so can anyone give me a single reason for keeping the
position closed?} b4 11. Ne4 $1 Nxe4 12. fxe4 a5 $6 {An inaccuracy - dxe5 was
better.} 13. exd6 exd6 14. Kb1 Nd7 (14... O-O $1 {Was a most logical choice;
anyway White is still better.}) 15. Bf4 $1 {Attacking the weak d6 pawn.} Ke7 $2

complicates his position. But that's not our subject.} fxe6 18. Rg1 Nf8 19. Qf2
