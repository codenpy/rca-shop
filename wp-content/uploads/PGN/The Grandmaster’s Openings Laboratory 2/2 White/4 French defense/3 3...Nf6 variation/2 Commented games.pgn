1. d4 e6 2. e4 d5 {Reaching the French...} 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 {Pinning the
knight and threatening e5; also following the principle of maximum activity.}
dxe4 {This move gives up the centre and White obtains a good position very
easily.} 5. Nxe4 Be7 6. Bxf6 gxf6 (6... Bxf6 {Is a more solid alternative but
6...gxf6 gives Black more counterplay.}) 7. Nf3 b6 8. Bb5+ c6 (8... Nd7 9. Bc6

O-O-O Nd7 12. Kb1 {This move is always useful in the 0-0-0 positions.} O-O-O
13. Ba6 $1 {The only merit in Black's position was the bishop pair; after this
move White exchanges one of the bishops, obtaining the advantage.} Rhg8 (13...
Bxa6 14. Qxa6+ Kb8 15. Qe2 {It's very similar to the game...}) 14. g3 Kb8 15.
Bxb7 Kxb7 16. Rd3 {The rook in the third rank has some interesting
perspectives. So this move is very stimulating..} (16. Ned2 {With the idea of
Ne4 directly is another possible idea...}) 16... f5 17. Ned2 Bf6 18. Rd1 {
Bringing into play the least active piece.} Rge8 19. Nc4 {The knight here is
excellently placed, keeping an eye on a lot of important squares and also
provoking a weakening...} b5 $6 {The move White wants to force!} 20. Ncd2 (20.
Nce5 $1 {Was better and more logical according to the principles move...})
20... Nb6 (20... e5 $1 {Was the freedom move. I don't know what persuaded
Granda to allow this and Ochoa to avoid it.} 21. dxe5 Nxe5 22. Rxd8 Rxd8 23.
Nxe5 Qxe5 24. Qxe5 Bxe5 25. c3 f4 $1 {And Black has no problems in this
position. The bishop compensates for the inferior pawn structure.}) 21. Nb3 Na4
22. Re3 (22. Ne5 {Was a more natural and better move, simply using the
principle of maximum activity.} Rd5 23. f4 $14) 22... Ka8 23. Ne1 {The
manoeuvre of this knight to d3 is an interesting idea.} Qb6 24. Qf3 {Defending
d4 indirectly.} Rd5 25. c3 $16 Qc7 26. Nd3 {The game is strategically decided.
In this variation, White should normally try to avoid the freedom moves like
e5 or c5. And exchanging the bishops with Ba6 is a good idea to keep in mind.}

1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 Be7 5. e5 Nfd7 6. Bxe7 {This exchange is
favourable for White in the French Defence in general, because the pawn
structure determines that the dark-squared bishop is more important for Black
than for White.} Qxe7 7. f4 {To give extra support to the e5 pawn.} O-O 8. Nf3
c5 9. dxc5 {This move is typical in this variation, when White give extra
support to e5. Because now the d4 square becomes an excellent square for the
knight.} Nc6 {The most flexible move: Black can then decide with which piece
he is going to take on c5.} (9... Nxc5) (9... Qxc5 {Are of course possible
options.}) 10. Bd3 f5 11. exf6 Qxf6 12. g3 Nxc5 13. O-O {This kind of position
is usually very comfortable for White due to the weak dark squares in Black's
territory and the weak e6 pawn.} Bd7 14. Qd2 Rad8 15. Rae1 Be8 16. a3 Bh5 17.

30. Kg1 Qxg4+ (30... Qg3+ {Is a bit more accurate.} 31. Kf1 Qxg4 $1 {This is
really strange: it's better to take on g4 without check, because the king on
f1 is worse placed than on g1.}) 31. Qg2 Qxf4 $2 (31... Qd1+ 32. Kh2 Qxd3 33.

with the knight it's a good idea to castle king side.} 10. Qd2 Nc6 11. O-O-O

queen, 0-0-0 is an excellent option; and when Black takes with the knight, 0-0
is better. Also the typical Bxh7+ sacrifice.} 1-0
