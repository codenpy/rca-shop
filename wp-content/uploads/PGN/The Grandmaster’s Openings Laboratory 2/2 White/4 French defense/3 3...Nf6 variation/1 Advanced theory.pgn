1. e4 e6 {This is known as the French Defence. The idea is to play d5 and
create a pawn chain in the centre and then attack it with c5.} 2. d4 {
Controlling the centre...} d5 3. Nc3 {This move doesn't define the position of
the "e" pawn and also follows the principle of least active piece and maximum
activity. So I think it is the best choice for White.} Nf6 {Putting pressure
on e4.} (3... c5 {This is a typical move in the French, but Black usually
tries to force White to play e5 first because White can now win a pawn.} 4.
exd5 exd5 5. dxc5 {And if Black recaptures on c5, the d5 pawn falls...}) 4. Bg5
Be7 {This move goes more into the spirit of the French than...} (4... dxe4 {
Black removes the pressure in the centre, but White gets a freer position with
good development and space advantage.} 5. Nxe4 Be7 6. Bxf6 Bxf6 (6... gxf6 {
This is a double-edged move. Black obtains a better pawn centre and the open
"g" file, but his pawn structure is very weak...} 7. Nf3 b6 (7... f5 8. Nc3 Bf6
9. Qd2 c5 10. d5 O-O 11. O-O-O e5 12. h4 {With good attacking chances for
White.}) (7... a6 8. Bd3 b5 9. Qe2 Bb7 10. O-O-O Nd7 11. Rhe1 {White has
finished the main opening tasks and has a better pawn structure; Black
compensates for this with the bishop pair...}) 8. Bb5+ {This move has the
purpose of closing the a8-h1 diagonal.} c6 {Blocking the diagonal with a piece
leaves the pieces with a lack of coordination...} (8... Nd7 9. Bc6) (8... Bd7
9. Bxd7+) 9. Bd3 Bb7 {Now you can see the objective of 8.Bb5+.} 10. Qe2 Qc7 11.
O-O-O Nd7 12. Kb1 O-O-O 13. Ba6 {To remove Black's bishop pair...} Rhg8 14.
Bxb7+ Kxb7 15. g3 {White is slightly better due to the pawn structure.}) 7. Nf3
{White can simply develop his pieces and obtain an attacking position...} O-O
8. Qd2 b6 9. O-O-O Bb7 10. Qf4 Nd7 11. Bd3 {And white has better chances of
attacking on the kingside than Black on the queen side...}) 5. e5 Nfd7 (5...
Ne4 {It's a secondary move - not very dangerous for White...} 6. Nxe4 dxe4 (
6... Bxg5 7. Nxg5 Qxg5 8. Nf3 Qe7 9. c3 {White has more space and a good
development.}) 7. Bxe7 Qxe7 8. Qe2 {Attacking the weak e4 pawn and preparing
to castle queen side.} b6 9. O-O-O (9. Qxe4 Qb4+ {Gives Black excellent play.}
10. c3 Qxb2 11. Rd1 Qxc3+ 12. Rd2 c6) 9... Bb7 10. g3 {Now it's time to attack
e4!} c5 11. Bg2 Nc6 12. dxc5 {And after all these complications, White has
obtained a slight advantage. For example...} Nxe5 (12... O-O 13. Bxe4 Nxe5 {
Transpose...}) (12... Qxc5 13. Bxe4 {And White is a pawn up...}) (12... bxc5
13. Bxe4) 13. Bxe4 O-O 14. f4 Rfd8 15. Rxd8+ Rxd8 16. Nh3 Nc6 17. cxb6 Nd4 18.
Qg2 Bxe4 19. Qxe4 {The position is complicated - but the advantages is on
White's side due to the material advantage; Black's compensation isn't very
clear...}) 6. Bxe7 Qxe7 7. f4 {In this kind of French structure, Black usually
tries to attack White's centre with c5. Against this, White normally has two
options: 1. support d4 with c3; 2. give enough support to e5. In this case the
knight is on c3 so option 1 doesn't look very good. This is why White chooses
option number 1 and gives e5 support.} a6 {In this kind of position, it's
important to prevent the manoeuvre Nb5-d6 - this is why c5 directly was
inaccurate...} (7... O-O 8. Nf3 {Maximum activity and least active piece...} c5
9. Qd2 {Preparing to castle queen side - now the manoeuvre Nb5-d6 is not so
strong because the Black king has already castled.} Nc6 10. dxc5 {White can
make this move when the d4 square is under his control, because it's very
important in this variation to control this square.} Qxc5 (10... Nxc5 11. Bd3 (
11. O-O-O {Is the normal move here but after...} a6 {I think that Black has
good options on the queen side.}) 11... f6 12. exf6 Qxf6 13. g3 Bd7 14. O-O {
And White has some positional advantage and his plan is very clear: create a
blockade over the central dark squares - always prevent the break on the e5
square.}) (10... f6 11. exf6 Qxf6 12. g3 Nxc5 13. O-O-O {And the plan against
this is: 1. control the dark squares in the centre; 2. prevent Black's
counterplay on the queen side.}) 11. O-O-O {Now we have on the board an
opposite castling position, when the normal plan for both sides is attack the
opponent's king.} Nb6 12. Kb1 {A prophylactic move - the king is much better
on b1 than on c1.} Bd7 13. Bd3 {Following the principle of maximum activity
and pointing towards Black's king.} Na5 (13... Nc4 14. Bxc4 Qxc4 15. f5 exf5
16. Qxd5 Qxd5 17. Nxd5 {And this endgame is slightly preferable for White.})
14. Bxh7+ {A typical sacrifice - White doesn't win directly but obtains
excellent compensation. The remaining moves are forced.} Kxh7 15. Ng5+ Kg8 16.
Qd3 Rfe8 17. Qh7+ Kf8 18. Qh8+ Ke7 19. Qxg7 Kd8 20. Nxf7+ Kc7 21. Nd6 $16 {
Three pawns for a piece and excellent attacking possibilities are almost
always evidence of good business!}) (7... c5 $6 8. Nb5 $1 {And the knight is
going to d6 while creating the threat of Nc7 and capturing the rook.}) 8. Nf3 {
Least active piece and maximum activity.} c5 (8... b6 {The idea is to play c5
and then recapture with the pawn to control the d4 square.} 9. Qd2 c5 10. Nd1 {
To support the centre with c3...} Nc6 11. c3 Bb7 12. Ne3 f6 13. Bd3 {White has
excellent possibilities because of his space advantage and the difference
between the bishops. He should finish development and then wait for the
position in the centre to become clear.}) 9. dxc5 {This move is typical and
now we reach a normal structure in this kind of variation. The usual idea for
White is to establish control of the d4 square and take advantage of Black's
bad bishop.} Nc6 (9... Qxc5 10. Qd2 Nc6 11. O-O-O b5 12. Ne2 {A natural
manoeuvre, with the idea of controlling d4.} Nb6 13. Ned4 Bd7 14. Nxc6 Bxc6 15.
Nd4) (9... Nxc5 10. Bd3 Nc6 11. O-O {Normally when Black takes on c5 with the
knight, it is preferable to castle king side because this will give White a
positional advantage with no risk. Castling queen side is very risky due to
the advance of the queen side pawns with a6-b5-b4, etc.} b5 12. Ne2 {And this
knight is going to d4, with a solid positional advantage for White.}) 10. Bd3 (
10. Qd2 {Is another alternative. The thing is that after...} Nxc5 {White
always wants to castle king side and Qd2 doesn't help that objective.}) 10...
Qxc5 (10... Nxc5 11. O-O {Transpose to the 9...Nxc5 variation.}) 11. Qd2 b5 (
11... Nb6 12. a3 {White is going to play b4, push away Black's queen and
castle king side.} Nc4 13. Bxc4 Qxc4 14. b3 {Here White has an excellent
forcing way for getting a clear advantage...} Qc5 15. Na4 Qe7 16. c4 $1 dxc4
17. Nb6 Rb8 18. Nxc4 $16 {White will have a dominating knight on d6.}) 12. a3 {
To prevent b4 followed by a5 and Ba6, exchanging Black's bad bishop.} Bb7 13.
Qf2 {The endgames are normally in White's favour, because of his good minor
pieces and great control of the dark squares.} Qxf2+ 14. Kxf2 Nc5 15. Ne2 {
With a slight but enduring advantage for White. The plan here is to use the d4
square and to attack slowly but surely on both flanks, seizing space.} *
