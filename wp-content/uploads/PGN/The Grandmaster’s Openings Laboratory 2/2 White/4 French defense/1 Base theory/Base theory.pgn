1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 {This is our starting point in the French Defence.

good position.}) 5. a3 Ba5 (5... Bxc3+ 6. bxc3 Ne7 7. Nf3 {And White's play is
really simple. White should only develop his pieces and later try to open the
position to take advantage of the bishop pair.}) 6. b4 $1 {And White will
later play Nb5 with great advantage.} cxd4 7. Nb5 Bc7 8. f4 Nc6 (8... Ne7 9.

{White's compensation for the pawn is huge.}) (3... Be7 4. Nf3 Nf6 5. Bd3 {In
this variation, it isn't really a problem to play with White - you should just
be careful about not playing e5 at an inappropriate moment.}) 4. Bg5 {Now
Black has three possibilities...} Bb4 (4... Be7 5. e5 Nfd7 6. Bxe7 Qxe7 7. f4 {
And White's situation is very comfortable, because after c5 from Black he will
exchange and then use the d4 square.} a6 8. Nf3 c5 9. dxc5 Nc6 (9... Nxc5 10.
