1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 {This move gives up the centre every quickly,
which isn't a very good idea. It also goes against the French Defence idea. So
that's why I don't think this move is the best for Black.} 4. Nxe4 Bd7 {This
bishop is going to find an excellent place on c6. The alternative is...} (4...
Nd7) 5. Nf3 {White is simply going to follow the openings tasks until move
number 8.} Bc6 6. Bd3 Nd7 7. O-O Ngf6 8. Ng3 $1 {This move has a very simple
idea. In general, in this variation it is not favourable for White to exchange
pieces because of his space advantage.} Be7 9. c4 {Winning more space.} O-O 10.
b3 {Preparing the development of the bishop. b2 is an excellent square,
because from here the bishop has hidden potential.} Bxf3 11. Qxf3 c6 {This is
what Black is looking for in this system: exchange the bad bishop and obtain a
solid position. Of course, this is very good for White, with a bishop pair and
space advantage.} 12. Bb2 Qa5 13. a3 $1 {Preventing the exchange of the
bishops with Ba3. This move is very important to maintain the advantage. Now
Black has two main alternatives.} b5 {It's the second main alternative.} (13...
Rfe8 {Is the main alternative of the position.} 14. Rfe1 Rad8 15. Re2 Nf8 16.
h4 {And White has good possibilities.}) 14. cxb5 cxb5 15. Rfe1 {Activating the
rook and, at the same time, threatening moves like Nf5.} Nd5 16. Nf5 N7f6 17.
Nxe7+ Nxe7 {White has two bishops against two knights.} 18. Bc3 Qd8 (18... Qb6

is a pawn up - the rest is easy.} Nfd5 20. Bb2 Qb6 21. Bc4 Rfd8 22. Rad1 Nc6

move has the idea of, after c5, recovering the pawn with 0-0, Qe2 and Rd1.} c5

c1 bishop (a3 or b2).} b6 11. d5 $1 {Opening up the position to attack Black's
weak king.} exd5 {Now it's all forced. White wins a pawn, obtaining a better
endgame, and the rest is easy for White.} 12. Bxd5 Nxd5 (12... Ra7 13. Ng5 Nxd5

1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nd2 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Nd7 5. Nf3 Ngf6 6. Nxf6+ Nxf6 7. Bd3 {
This move has the advantage, in relation to Bc4, of making a kingside attack
possible. The bishop is better placed on d3 than on c4. The problem is that
White can't use the "d" file.} c5 8. dxc5 Bxc5 9. O-O {This is one of the most
typical pawn structures in this variation. It has the following points: 1. a
queen side majority for White. 2. There is no clear weaknesses on this
position. 3. White's pieces are pointing to the king side.} O-O 10. Qe2 b6 11.
Bg5 Bb7 12. Rad1 Qc7 {For Black, it's better to allow the doubled pawns than
keep the knight pinned.} (12... Qe7 13. Ne5 h6 14. Bh4 $14 g5 {Doesn't look
very good for Black.} 15. Bg3 {And, at some point, h4 - attacking Black's weak
position.}) 13. Bxf6 gxf6 {Let's evaluate this position. White has a better
pawn structure and a safer king; Black has the bishop pair; so after White's
next move, the position is a slight advantage for White.} 14. Be4 $1 Rfd8 15.
c3 Kh8 16. g3 {White is consolidating his position.} Bf8 17. a3 Bg7 18. Bxb7
Qxb7 19. Rd3 {The "d" file has a special importance in this variation.
Dominating it can give you great chances.} f5 20. Rfd1 Rxd3 21. Rxd3 Bf6 22.
