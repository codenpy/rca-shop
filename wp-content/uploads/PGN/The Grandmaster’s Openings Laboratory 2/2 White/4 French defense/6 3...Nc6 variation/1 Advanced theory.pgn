1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nc6 {This variation is very secondary and not too
complicated for White to obtain an advantage.} 4. Nf3 {Simply following the
principle of maximum activity and least active piece; and not playing e5 until
Black forces this move.} Nf6 (4... Bb4 5. e5) 5. e5 Ne4 6. Bd3 Bb4 7. O-O $5 (
7. Bd2 {It's a solid option and White gest a good position without too many
problems.} Nxd2 8. Qxd2 f6 9. a3 Be7 10. exf6 Bxf6 11. Bb5 O-O 12. Bxc6 bxc6
13. Na4 {And the knights are better than the bishops. Anyway, White should
play carefully and not allow Black to open the position. Control of the c5 and
the e5 squares is key.}) 7... Nxc3 8. bxc3 Bxc3 9. Rb1 {I like White's
compensation. Just for a pawn, Black has problems with his king. Castling king
side allow sacrifices like Bxh7+.} O-O $2 (9... h6 10. Be3 {And White has
compensation for the pawn.}) 10. Bxh7+ Kxh7 11. Ng5+ (11. Qd3+ {Is enough but
after...}) 11... Kg8 12. Qh5 {White is winning.} *
