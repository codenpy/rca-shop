1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Bb4 {This is probably the main line in the French
Defence. The idea of Black's last move is to attack indirectly the e4 pawn,
forcing White to make a decision.} 4. e5 {Seizing space} c5 {This is the
typical rupture of the French Defence, attacking the d4 pawn which is the
defender of the e5 pawn.} (4... b6 {With the idea of exchanging the bad bishop.
This move is very interesting.} 5. Qg4 {A natural and typical move here. When
the bishop comes out first before the knight, this move is typical in many
openings. Attacking g7, White forces Black to take an important decision.} Bf8
{For me, this is the best for Black. 5... g6 weakens the dark squares very
much. And 5... Kf8 interrupts the coordination of the pieces and also loses
the possibility of castling.} 6. Bg5 {Attacking move! Also following the
principle of maximum activity.} Qd7 (6... Ne7 {Isn't very good due to...} 7.
Bxe7 {And Black has no good answer...} Kxe7 (7... Qxe7 8. Nxd5) 8. Nf3) 7.
O-O-O h6 8. Be3 Ne7 9. Kb1 {It's definitely more accurate than Bd3, because
White can win a tempo exchanging directly on a6.} Ba6 10. Bxa6 Nxa6 11. Qe2 {
The queen is doing nothing on g4 and White's plan is to push the king side
pawns.} Nb8 12. g4 $5 {Seizing space on the king side and preparing f4-f5
looks promising for White.}) (4... Ne7 5. a3 Bxc3+ 6. bxc3 b6 {With the idea
of exchanging the light-squared bishops.} (6... c5 {Transpose to the main line.
}) 7. Qg4 Ng6 8. h4 h5 9. Qd1 {The idea of Qd1 is to keep an eye on the h5
pawn.} Ba6 10. Bxa6 Nxa6 11. Bg5 {Maximum activity and attack...} Qd7 12. Ne2 {
Threatening Ng3.} Qc6 13. O-O Ne7 14. a4 {This position is favourable to White.
Black's position is planless and with the king in the centre things shouldn't
be comfortable for him.}) 5. a3 {Attacking the bishop, forcing Black into a
decision.} Bxc3+ (5... Ba5 {It's a complicated and not very popular variation,
but I think it's very important to study it.} 6. b4 $1 {This move has the idea
of unpinning the knight and playing Nb5.} cxd4 7. Nb5 {Threatening Nd6+.} Bc7
8. f4 {Defending e5...} Ne7 (8... Bd7 9. Nxc7+ Qxc7 10. Nf3 Ba4 11. Bd3 {It's
very similar to the main line.}) (8... Nc6 {This move has the problem that
sometimes Black wants to make the manoeuvre Bd7-a4 and this move interrupts
the e8-a4 diagonal.} 9. Nf3 Bb8 $5 {The main idea of Nc6.} 10. Bb2 Nge7 11.
Nbxd4 {And White has a solid advantage.}) 9. Nf3 {Following the principle of
least active piece and maximum activity.} Bd7 10. Nxc7+ $1 {This bishop is a
very important piece for Black, so it's a good idea exchange it.} Qxc7 11. Bd3
{With an excellent position for White. The d4 pawn is almost lost and White
has a bishop pair, a solid position and possibilities on the dark squares.}) (
5... cxd4 6. axb4 dxc3 7. Nf3 {Developing the least active piece.} Qc7 8. bxc3
Qxc3+ 9. Bd2 Qc7 10. Bd3 $14 {White has a bishop pair and development for just
one pawn.}) 6. bxc3 Ne7 (6... Qa5 {The idea of this move is to win a tempo 
(attacking c3) to put the queen on a4, creating a blockade and attacking the
c2 pawn.} 7. Bd2 Qa4 8. Qg4 {The typical move of the variation. Now Black is
forced to make a decision.} g6 {The problem with this move in the Winawer
French is that it weakens the dark squares very much and the bishop for those
squares is missing.} (8... Kf8 9. Nf3 {White doesn't need to defend the c2
pawn.} Nc6 10. Be2 {White simply develops his pieces.} Qxc2 11. O-O cxd4 12.
cxd4 Qe4 13. Qxe4 dxe4 14. Ng5 $44 {Now in this position White has a lot of
compensation for the pawn: his king is safer and the bishop pair is very
strong, as the following variations can show.} Nxd4 (14... f5 15. exf6 Nxf6 16.
Bc4 h6 17. Nxe6+ Bxe6 18. Bxe6 Nxd4 19. Bc4 {The bishop pair is very strong!
Also Black's knights don't have good squares and the e4 pawn is weak.}) 15. Bc4
Ne7 16. Rad1 Ndc6 17. Nxe4 {The bishop pair, the d6 square and the position of
Blacks pieces determines White's compensation.}) 9. Nf3 Nc6 (9... Qxc2 10. Rc1
Qa4 (10... Qe4+ {Doesn't work very nicely for Black.} 11. Qxe4 dxe4 12. Ng5 f5
13. exf6 Nxf6 14. Bc4 {This endgame is advantageous for White.}) 11. c4 {Time
to open up the position with a better development, the bishop pair and great
possibilities on the dark squares.}) 10. Be2 Bd7 11. O-O c4 12. Ra2 {It's time
to defend the pawn, with great possibilities on the dark squares.}) (6... Qc7 {
It's very similar to 6...Ne7, just the fact that 6...Ne7 is more flexible
because the queen can go to a5 or c7.} 7. Nf3 Ne7 8. a4 {It's very similar to
the main line. 6...Ne7. The move Qc7 doesn't have any special idea.}) 7. Nf3 {
This move isn't the main one. But in my opinion it's a great alternative to
the main 7. Qg4 and avoids the complications. From here the position is going
to be decided by understanding and not by memorising variations. In this
position, Black has four main alternatives} Nbc6 {Simply developing a knight -
this move is also very flexible.} (7... b6 {With the idea of exchanging the
bad bishop.} 8. Bb5+ Bd7 (8... Kf8 9. dxc5 bxc5 10. O-O Bd7 (10... c4 11. Bxc4)
11. Be2 Ba4 12. c4 d4 13. Qd3 {Followed by c3 with excellent play.}) 9. a4 $1 {
With the idea of forcing the exchange in a favourable way.} Bxb5 10. axb5 {Now
the "a" file is opened and the a7 pawn is weak. Black has three main choices...
} a5 (10... Qd7 {Winning the b5 pawn but White obtains excellent compensation.}
11. Qe2 c4 12. Ba3 Qxb5 13. Ng5 Qd7 14. Qh5 $44 Ng6 (14... g6 15. Qf3 Ng8 16.
O-O $44) 15. O-O {And White has a lot of compensation, based on activity.}) 11.
dxc5 bxc5 12. O-O O-O 13. c4 {And the c5 pawn is clearly weak, as is the a5
one. The bishop on c1 is clearly the superior minor piece. White has the
advantage.}) (7... Bd7 {The idea is to put this bishop on a4, so White's move
is very easy to understand.} 8. a4 {Preventing Ba4.} Qa5 9. Bd2 Nbc6 10. Be2 {
Transposing to a variation that we are going to see later.}) (7... Qa5 8. Bd2
c4 (8... Qa4 {It's a bit more accurate for Black.} 9. Bd3 c4 10. Be2 Nbc6 11.
O-O Bd7 12. Nh4 {With the plan of f4-f5. This kind of position used to be a
slight advantage for White, because it's easier to play with the White pieces
here.}) 9. Be2 $1 Bd7 (9... Qa4 10. O-O Nbc6 11. Nh4 Bd7 12. Bh5 O-O 13. Ra2)
10. a4 $1 {It's important to prevent Ba4 with the pawn on a3.} Bxa4 (10... Nbc6
11. O-O f6) 11. O-O b5 12. Ng5 Nbc6 13. Bh5 (13. f4 h6) 13... g6 14. Bg4 {Now
White has a lot of compensation for the pawn. The bishop on a4 has no movement
and the dark squares are weak.}) 8. a4 {This move is typical to prevent Black
from using the a4 square. Also the a3 square can be useful for White in some
variations.} Qa5 9. Bd2 c4 {Blocking the position and preventing c4 in some
variations.} (9... Bd7 10. Be2 f6 (10... O-O 11. O-O c4 12. Nh4 {Looking for
f4-g4 and then f5.}) (10... O-O-O 11. O-O c4 12. Bc1 $5 {An interesting
concept.} (12. Qc1 {Is safer and also good - the idea is to put the queen on
a3.}) 12... Qxc3 13. Ra2 Qa5 14. Ba3 $44) (10... c4 11. O-O f6 12. exf6 gxf6
13. Bf4 $1 {Not a move that is used much, but very strong; the bishop is going
to d6.} Ng6 14. Bd6 Qxc3 15. a5 $1 {Trapping the queen!} Nxa5 (15... Kf7 16.
Ra3 Qb2 17. Qd2 {With big compensation for the pawn.}) 16. Qb1 $1 Nc6 17. Rd1 {
Followed by Ra3.}) 11. c4 Qc7 $13 {The opening up of the position should
favour White because of his bishop pair.} 12. exf6 gxf6 13. dxc5 $14) 10. g3
Bd7 11. Bh3 {Here the bishop is better than on g2, because it controls
important squares like f5 and e6 can become important later.} O-O-O 12. O-O Kb8
13. Qe2 {And White has a slight advantage, with possibilities of attack on
both flanks - on the king side using a pawn storm f4-f5 well prepared, and on
the queen side using the "b" file and the a3-f8 diagonal. Now this is a big
file with a lot of variations. But it's more important to remember the typical
ideas than the variations. So I have decided to put a review here: 1. Play on
the dark squares, using the diagonal a3-f8 and attacking squares like g7.2.
Play c4, opening up the position for the bishop pair. 3. Attack on the king
side with f4-f5 and create some weaknesses first with moves like Ng5, Qh5, etc.
This is the basic theme of this variation. Also if you have noticed any other
important idea, write it down!} *
