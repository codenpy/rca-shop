1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.e5 b6 {From a static point of view,
this move looks good for Black; but White obtains a lot of development.}
5.Qg4 {A typical move in the Winawer Variation: Black has to
take an important decision.} Bf8 6.Bg5 {Attacking move! This
is ideal in chess.} Qd7 7.O-O-O Ne7 8.Bxe7 h5 9.Qh3 {From here
the queen controls very important squares like f5 and h5.} Bxe7 10.f4 {The
natural plan for White in this pawn structure is to play f5,
attacking the pawn chain and opening the position.} Bb7 (10...Ba6 {Is
more natural - White gets a good position after...} 11.Bxa6 Nxa6 12.Kb1
{Followed by a plan like Qe3-h3-Nf3/e2-g4-f5. The important thing
is to prepare f5.}) 11.Nf3 Nc6 12.Ng5 {Preventing Black from
castling queen side.} g6 13.Be2 Na5 14.Kb1 (14.g4 {Directly is
also possible.}) 14...a6 15.g4 h4 16.Rhf1 {Preparing f5.} b5 17.Bd3 Nc4
18.Ne2 (18.Nxf7 $5 {This sacrifice is very typical in this pawn
structure.} Kxf7 19.f5 Kg8 20.f6 Bb4 21.Bxg6 {And the "f" and
"g" pawns can now sweep forward.}) 18...Qc6 19.Ka1 {A prophylactic
move but not very necessary...} a5 20.Nxf7 $5 Kxf7 21.f5 gxf5 $2 (21...g5 $1

{In this game, you should learn at least two things: 1. the typical

1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.e5 Ne7 5.a3 Bxc3+ 6.bxc3 b6 {With
the same idea we saw in the previous game: exchange the bad bishop.} 7.Qg4
{Again, the typical answer. In this case, it's a bit different
because Black no longer has his dark-squared bishop.} Ng6 (7...O-O {Is
another option; White can simply play...} 8.Bg5 {Putting pressure
on Black's position.} Qd7 9.Bd3 Ba6 10.Bxh7+ Kxh7 11.Qh4+ {Is
a trick you should take into account.} Kg8 12.Bxe7 Qa4 13.Kd2 $1 {And
White is winning due to the double threat 13. Bxf8 and 13. Bf6!!} Re8 14.Bf6 $1)
8.h4 h5 9.Qd1 (9.Qg3 {Is another alternative that looks better
at first sight; but taking a deeper look into the position, we
can understand that attacking the h5 pawn is very important here.
That's why 9.Qd1 is the move I like the most.}) 9...Ba6 10.Bxa6 Nxa6 11.Bg5
{Developing and attacking...} Qd7 12.Ne2 {Going for Ng3.} Qc6 13.O-O Ne7
14.Qd3 {Developing and attacking.} Nb8 15.Ng3 {It's time to attack
h5. You may think: "What if Black simply protects this pawn with
g6?" This is White's idea - he doesn't want to win the pawn;
the idea is to provoke g6 and then attack on the weak dark squares.} Nd7
16.Qf3 g6 {Now the objective is reached, it's time to rethink
the position. It looks like White should try to open up the position
- preparing c4 looks very logical.} 17.a4 {This move is very
useful: 1. threatens a5; 2. The a3 square can be used by the
bishop (Bc1-a3) or even by a rook.} a5 18.Rfd1 Nf5 19.Ra3 Ra7 20.Nf1 Nf8
21.Bc1 Nh7 22.g3 Kd7 $2 (22...O-O $1 {And Black is ok...}) 23.Ne3 $1 {Now
Black's position becomes desperate...} Kc8 24.c4 $1 Nxe3 25.Bxe3 Qd7 26.cxd5

this game, you should learn at least: 1. the idea of attacking
h5 to provoke g6; 2. a typical idea in the Winawer Variation
is to open the position to take advantage of the bishop against
knight - c4 is a common way to do this.}   1-0

1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.e5 c5 5.a3 Ba5 {This is a secondary
variation.} 6.b4 {The idea is unpin the knight to go to b5.} cxd4 7.Nb5

e5 pawn.} Ne7 9.Nf3 Bd7 10.Nxc7+ {If you understand the properties
of this pawn structure, this exchange doesn't need explanation.
The dark squares are very weak.} (10.Nbxd4 {Is a less strong
but acceptable option.}) 10...Qxc7 11.Bd3 {White doesn't hurry
to take on d4, because it's lost anyway and White can use the
time to finish his development and then maybe recapture it in
a better way.} a6 12.Bb2 Nbc6 13.O-O Rc8 14.Qe1 $1 {The queen has
excellent possibilities (f2,g3 or h4) from this square; also
defends b4 and can help to play a4.} Nf5 15.Qf2 Nce7 16.a4 $1 {Seizing

pieces haven't played. White has optimal coordination.} Qd8 22.Bd4 {Black

1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.e5 c5 5.a3 Bxc3+ 6.bxc3 Qa5 {The idea
of this move is to blockade the queen side with Qa4 - the problem
is that the king side feels lonely.} 7.Bd2 Qa4 8.Qg4 $1 {Logical
move! White should attack on the king side - the c2 pawn doesn't
matter.} Kf8 9.Nf3 Ne7 (9...Qxc2 {Is also possible, but White
doesn't have any problem in getting compensation - as you can
see in the theory section.}) 10.Be2 b6 11.c4 $1 {A typical move
