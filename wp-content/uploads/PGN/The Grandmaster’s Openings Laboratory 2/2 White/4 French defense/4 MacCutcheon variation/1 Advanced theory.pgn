1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 Bb4 {This is the starting point of the
Maccutcheon Variation, one of the most complex of all in the French Defence.}
5. e5 {A very natural move, seizing space and attacking the pinned knight.
Black has just one reply.} h6 6. Bd2 {The most popular option...} (6. Be3 {Is
another option, more complicated and difficult to understand, and not
necessarily better.}) 6... Bxc3 7. bxc3 Ne4 8. Qg4 {As you already know, this
move is very typical and useful in the French Defence. By attacking g7, White
forces Black into an important decision.} g6 {Weakening the dark squares.} (
8... Kf8 {Losing the possibility of castling is the other option.} 9. Bd3 Nxd2
10. Kxd2 c5 {The typical rupture in the French...} (10... Qg5+ {Is a very
solid option. In this position, obtaining the initiative is complicated.} 11.
Qxg5 hxg5 12. h4 $5 {The idea is to open the position on the king side, where
White has more possibilities of obtaining an advantage.} c5 (12... gxh4 13. Nf3
h3 14. Rh2 $1 {A really difficult move to find but with a clear idea - double
the rooks and then just recover the pawn.} Ke7 15. Rah1 $5 {Sacrificing a pawn
for the initiative; 15.g3 is a more solid option.} hxg2 16. Rxh8 gxh1=Q 17.
Rxh1 {Here White has enough compensation for the pawn, even a slight advantage.
I don't think it's enough for a win, but at least your opponent should have to
play very accurately.} Bd7 18. Rh7 Nc6 19. Rxg7 Rh8 20. Ng5 Be8 21. Nh7 $1 {
And White has the advantage in this endgame, due to his more active pieces.})
13. Nf3 g4 14. Nh2 Nc6 (14... Rxh4 15. g3 Rh3 16. Nxg4 Rxh1 17. Rxh1) 15. Ke3
c4 16. Be2 {And the advantage is on White's side.} Rxh4 17. Nxg4) 11. h4 {
Preparing to develop the rook using the third rank - like amateurs used to do :
)} Nc6 (11... c4 12. Be2 Nc6 13. Rh3 b5 14. Rg3 Rg8 15. Qf4 Bd7 16. Bh5 Be8 17.
Nh3 {It's the same as 11... Nc6.}) 12. Rh3 c4 13. Be2 b5 14. Rg3 {Attacking g7.
} Rg8 15. Qf4 {Now it's time to put pressure on the f7 square.} Bd7 16. Bh5 Be8
17. Nh3 {White has a good attacking position. His plan is to manoeuvre the
pieces on the king side, trying to create an attack. Also White should be
careful about Black's counterplay on the other side.}) 9. Bd3 {Attacking
Black's well-placed knight.} Nxd2 10. Kxd2 c5 11. Nf3 {Developing a piece and
following the principle of maximum activity.} (11. h4 {Is another valid option.
}) 11... Nc6 {Black doesn't define his position. And developing a piece keeps
the pressure on...} (11... Bd7 {This move has the idea of placing the pieces
in a different way (Bc6 and Nd7). In this way, the f6 square is going to be
better protected.} 12. h4 Qe7 13. Qf4 Bc6 14. Nh2 {Manoeuvring to reach the f6
square.} Nd7 15. Ng4 O-O-O 16. Nxh6 {Grabbing a pawn - but Black can recover
it.} f5 17. g4 {This move is made to help the h6 knight.} cxd4 18. cxd4 fxg4
19. Nxg4 Rxh4 20. Rxh4 g5 (20... Qxh4 21. Rg1 Rf8 22. Qh6 $1 Rxf2+ 23. Ke3 $1
Rh2 24. Qxh4 Rxh4 25. Nf2 Nf8 26. Bxg6 {With a better endgame for White.}) 21.
Qe3 gxh4 22. Rh1 {And I prefer White's position a little, due to the
apparently good but actually weak h4 pawn and the better minor pieces.}) (11...
c4 12. Be2 Bd7 13. h4 Bc6 14. Qf4 Nd7 15. Nh2 Qe7 16. Ng4 O-O-O 17. Nxh6 {This
is very similar to the previous variation - just the fact that the position is
closed on the queen side; it favours White a little.}) 12. Qf4 {The queen is
very well placed here, attacking the f6 square, which is very important in
this position.} Qa5 (12... cxd4 13. cxd4 Qa5+ 14. c3 b6 15. Qf6 {The reason
for the move Qf4!} Rg8 16. a4 $1 {Preparing the next clever idea...} Ba6 17.
Bb5 $1 {A very creative move - temporarily sacrificing a pawn to obtain open
files on the queen side...} Bxb5 18. axb5 Qxb5 19. Rhb1 Qc4 20. Rxb6 {With a
clear advantage for White due to the activity of his heavy pieces.}) 13. Rhb1
cxd4 (13... c4 14. Be2 Qa3 15. h4 {And White should be better here, because he
is threatening Qf6, so Black should probably return his queen to e7; and then
the manoeuvre Nh2-g4 looks good.}) 14. Nxd4 Nxd4 15. Qxd4 {And here White's
bishop is better than Black's bishop. The White queen is very good -
centralised. White has more development and good attacking chances. This is
compensation for the fact that white has a bad pawn structure. His plan is to
attack Black on the dark squares and play depending on what Black does with
his king.} *
