1. e4 c5 2. Ne2 e6 (2... Nc6 3. d4 {Same idea than 2...e6 variation.}) (2...
Nf6 3. Nbc3 d6 4. d4 {Transposing to tha main line.}) (2... e5 3. Nbc3 {And
white position is a little bit strategically superior.}) (2... d6 3. g3 $5 (3.
d4 {Simply transposes to the main line and if white doesnt like the move 3.
g3!? can simply play this.}) 3... Nc6 (3... d5 $5 4. Bg2 dxe4 5. Nbc3 f5 6. O-O
{And white has a lot of development and positional compensation ( the move f5
weak blacks position) for the pawn i consider this position slighty favourable
for white.}) 4. Bg2 g6 5. c3 Bg7 6. d4 $14 {This is one of the reasons why
Najdorf, Scheveningen, Classical and Dragon players should feel a little bit
umconfortable against 2.Ne2.}) 3. d4 {Transposing to the normal lines. Just
that maybe with 2.Ne2 your opponent thought more than with the normal 2.Nf3.
As you can see in the worst of the case of the 2.Ne2 variation you transpose
to the main line making your opponent use some extra time. and has some extra
points in favour like the 2...d6 variation. I think this variation deserves
serious study and your students can love it the way i love it.} *
