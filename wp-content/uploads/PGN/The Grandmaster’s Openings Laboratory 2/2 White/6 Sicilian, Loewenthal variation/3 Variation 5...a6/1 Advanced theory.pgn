1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 e5 {...so called Loewenthal variation...
an interesting deviation from the Sveshnikov opening. This opening is very
popular at club level. Even some GMs include this variation into their
repertoires.} 5. Nb5 {White's knight aims at Black's weak 'd6' square that was
created by Black's last move...} a6 (5... d6 $5 {See 5..d6 in theory section.})
6. Nd6+ {The strategic drawback to this 5...a6 variation is that (i) Black has
to give up his dark-squared bishop for a knight despite the dark colour
weakness in his camp; (ii) Black has a backward pawn in the semi-open 'd' file.
} Bxd6 $8 7. Qxd6 Qf6 (7... Qe7 {A reasonable alternative to be considered...}
8. Qd1 {Queen back to its original square... not redundant to any of his
pieces; his plan is Nc3, Bc4, 0-0 etc. with a good game.} Nf6 9. Nc3 h6 (9...

Bg4 $5 12. f3 Be6 $14 {Similar to the main line..}) 12. Nd5 {Forcing Black to
take on d5, so as to create a pawn majority on the queen side.} Bxd5 13. exd5 {
White successfully creates a pawn majority on the queen side...} Nb8 14. Be2 {
Idea is to play c4,b4, a nice direct way for taking advantage of his pawn
majority.} Nbd7 15. c4 O-O 16. O-O Rac8 17. b4 $14) 11. Nd5 $1 Nxd5 (11... Qd6

Black's weak dark squares is evident...}) 12. Bxd5 O-O 13. O-O Bb7 14. f4 $36 {
White opens up the position so that he can take control of Black's weaknesses
with the help of his bishops.}) 8. Qd2 {Avoiding exchange is necessary... as
Black has lots of weak squares, e.g. d6, d5, f5, c7 and b6, for which White
can continue some attacking plan in the middlegame.} Qg6 (8... Nge7 $5 9. Nc3
O-O (9... d6 $5 10. Bd3 Be6 11. O-O Rd8 12. f4 $36) 10. Bd3 d6 (10... h6 $5 {
Back tries to restrict White's dark bishop...} 11. b3 $5 {But White discovers
another key diagonal for his dark bishop in this way...} d6 12. Bb2 Be6 13. O-O

Qg5 (11. O-O $5 h6 12. Qe3 Be6 13. Qb6 Rab8 14. f4 $36) 11... Qxg5 12. Bxg5 {
Preparing 0-0-0 and thus creating pressure on d6... White has an easier game
in comparison to Black...}) 9. Nc3 {Best amongst all probable alternatives...
maintaining the principle of least active piece... simple chess!} Nge7 (9...
Nf6 $6 10. Qd6 Ng4 11. Qxg6 hxg6 12. Nd5 {Followed by h3, f3, Be3 and Bc4, etc.
, with a better position for White.}) (9... d5 $6 {This premature break
doesn't help Black either.} 10. Nxd5 Qxe4+ (10... Rb8 11. f3 $16) 11. Be2 Qxg2

blunder due to White's next series of moves...} 14. Qg5+ $1 Qxg5 15. Bxg5+ f6

position...}) 14. Kf1 Nxa1 15. b3 $36 {White has a decisive edge... he is
threatening Qg5, Qc3 or Nb6, etc.}) 12. Nc7+ Kf8 13. Rf1 Rb8 14. b3 $40 {
Followed by Ba3 and 0-0-0, mounting pressure on Black's camp... anybody would
like to play with White in this position!}) 10. h4 {Preparing h5 for attacking
the queen and throwing her out of her ideal square...} Nd4 (10... h5 $6 11. Qg5

targets...}) (10... d5 $6 11. h5 Qg4 12. f3 Qg3+ 13. Qf2 Qxf2+ 14. Kxf2 d4 (

idea of Bd2, c3 and cxd4, and an excellent endgame for White...}) 11. h5 {
White successfully destroys Black's king side... and creating space there at
the same time!!} Qg4 {Untested, but a possible alternative which we can't
ignore at all.} (11... Qc6 12. Bd3 O-O (12... d5 $6 {Good-looking but
premature...} 13. Qg5 dxe4 14. Bxe4 Qd6 15. Be3 f5 16. O-O-O $1 Qf6 (16... fxe4

and king side as well; his next plan is cxd5, 0-0 and h6, thus creating more
pressure on Black's camp...}) 13. h6 g6 14. Ne2 $14 {White enjoys a slight
edge; his next plan is b3, Bb2, f4, 0-0-0 or c3 followed by f4 with better

in the position for White!!}) 13. Qd1 $1 {White is happy to eliminate Black's
strongest piece at this moment, his endgame - with bishop pair against lots of
Black weaknesses - is also a decisive factor...} d5 (13... Qxd1+ $6 14. Kxd1 d5

the bishop pair, a smaller pawn island and fewer weaknesses in comparison to
Black; his next plan is to play Kf2, Be3, Rah1, etc., with good practical
chances!!} *
