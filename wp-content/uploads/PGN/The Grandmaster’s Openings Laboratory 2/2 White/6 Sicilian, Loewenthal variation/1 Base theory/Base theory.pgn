1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 e5 {Popular Loewenthal variation of the
Sicilian Defence...} 5. Nb5 {This is the result of Black's last move, which
weakens the key 'd6' square... and Black hasn't yet played 'a6' to cover the
important 'b5' square, as seen in other variations of the Sicilian Defence.} d6
{(the main line of Loewenthal variation....)} (5... a6 {An interesting
alternative in Loewenthal...} 6. Nd6+ {The 5...a6 variation in Loewenthal has
its own limitations: firstly, Black creates dark-coloured weaknesses; secondly,
Black's pawn structure is inadequate as well...} Bxd6 7. Qxd6 {White
successfully removes Black's dark-squared bishop, without which Black has to
work extremely hard to cover his dark-coloured weakness...} Qf6 (7... Qe7 $5 {
Here, Black's queen doesn't occupy the 'f6' square, which is an ideal square
for his king's knight...} 8. Qd1 {Necessary move... keep the queen on the
board until a visible edge emerges...} Nf6 9. Nc3 h6 10. Bc4 {The principle of
maximum activity...} d6 $5 11. Be3 Be6 12. Nd5 {Provoking Black to take on d5,
which is good for White due to the creation of a pawn majority on the queen
side...} Bxd5 13. exd5 {White finally obtains a pawn majority on the queen
side, which is to his advantage in the endgame...} Nb8 14. Be2 {With the idea
of a pawn march along the queen side, where he has pawn majority... White has
space on the queen side with pair of bishops.}) 8. Qd2 {Black has some weak
squares in his camp - that is why White is trying to keep his queen right now..
.} Qg6 (8... Nge7 $5 9. Nc3 O-O 10. Bd3 d6 11. Qg5 Qxg5 12. Bxg5 {Preparing
0-0-0 and thus increasing the pressure on d6...}) 9. Nc3 {The principle of
least active piece works here...} Nge7 10. h4 Nd4 (10... h5 $6 11. Qg5 Nb4 12.
Qxg6 Nxg6 13. Kd1 $1 d6 14. a3 Nc6 15. Nd5 {White gains a strong initiative in
this position... his plan is to play Be3 and 0-0-0.}) (10... O-O $6 11. h5 Qe6
12. h6 g6 13. Nd5 {White has an ideal attacking position on both sides...}) 11.
h5 {A two-fold move: attacking Black's king side and creating space there...}
Qg4 {Untested, but a reasonable one.} (11... Qc6 12. Bd3 O-O (12... f5 $6 13.
Qg5 Ne6 14. Qh4 fxe4 15. Bxe4) 13. h6 g6 14. Ne2 $14 {White's next plan is to
play b3, Bb2, f4, 0-0-0 or c3 followed by f4 with better prospects...}) 12. h6
$1 {Weakening Black's king position...} gxh6 (12... g6 13. Qd3 {Opens up lines
for his dark-squared bishop...} O-O 14. Be3 $16 {Followed by f3, 0-0-0 and an
attack on the king side...}) 13. Qd1 $1 {White tries to exchange queens, as he
has better prospects in the endgame...} d5 14. Qxg4 Bxg4 15. Bd3 O-O-O 16. f3
dxe4 17. Nxe4 Bf5 18. Rxh6 $14 {White enjoys the power of the bishop pair...
he also has a smaller pawn island and fewer weaknesses; his next plan is Kf2,
Be3, Rah1.}) 6. c4 $1 {White aims to form a Maroczy Bind pawn structure and to
place a knight on d5 followed by a pawn storm along queen to try and create a
passed pawn there...} Be7 7. N1c3 a6 {Best choice here, as White's b5 knight
can't go to c3 now...} (7... Be6 $6 8. Nd5 Rc8 $14 {White can now play Nbc3
directly, rather than through a long a3-b1 manoeuvre.}) 8. Na3 Be6 (8... f5 $5
{Though this move creates space on the king side for Black, it weakens his
light squares and increases his pawn islands.} 9. exf5 Bxf5 10. Bd3 Bxd3 (10...
Be6 $5 11. Qh5+ Bf7 12. Qh3 {Followed by 0-0 and Rd1, with a superior position
for White...}) 11. Qxd3 Nb4 12. Qd1 Nf6 13. O-O O-O 14. Qb3 $36 {With the idea
of Nc2-Ne3... leading to a good position for White!}) (8... Nf6 $6 {Very hard
to ignore this move: Black has to give up his thematic plan for ... f5 or ...
Bg5 after this normal looking knight move!}) 9. Nc2 {Improving the position of
this isolated knight and preventing Black's possible Nd4...} Rc8 (9... Bg5 $5 {
Black tries to eliminate his bad bishop for White's good one...} 10. Be2 $5
Bxc1 11. Rxc1 Nf6 12. O-O O-O 13. Qd2 {Followed by Rfd1 and creating huge
pressure on 'd6' here; White has an easier game to play...}) 10. Nd5 $5 Bg5 (
10... Nf6 $5 11. Bd3 {With normal development and plan...}) (10... Bxd5 $6 11.
exd5 $14 {White has pawn majority on the queen side...}) 11. Bxg5 (11. Bd3 $5 {
Interesting alternative...} Bxc1 12. Rxc1 Nf6 13. O-O O-O 14. b4 {With the
idea of Qd2 and Rfd1, and pressure along the d-file...}) 11... Qxg5 12. g3 h5 (
12... Nh6 $5 13. Bg2 f5 14. f4 Qg6 15. O-O O-O 16. Qe2 {Followed by Rad1/
Bf3-Bh5, thereby increasing pressure on Black's camp. .}) 13. h4 {Necessary!
Is stopping Black's 'h' pawn, which limits Black's counterplay.} Qg6 (13... Qg4
14. Bg2 Qxd1+ 15. Rxd1 $14 {White has a nice endgame position... Black can't
cover the d6 and b6 squares, for which he has to play passively in the endgame.
}) 14. Bg2 Nh6 $5 (14... Nf6 $5 15. Qe2 O-O 16. O-O $11 {Though the position
is level, White's additional plan of a pawn march along the queen side gives
him a positional edge; on the other hand, Black has no clear plan that's
suitable for this position.}) 15. O-O {White's idea is to play Nde3, Qd3 and
Rad1, thus centralising his pieces, and to play a4 and b4 followed by a5, b5,
creating pressure on the queen side; this gives White a strategically better
position!} *
