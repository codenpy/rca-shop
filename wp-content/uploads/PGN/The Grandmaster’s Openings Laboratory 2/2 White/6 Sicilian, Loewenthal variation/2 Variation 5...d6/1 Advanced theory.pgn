1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 e5 5. Nb5 {Basic idea of 5.Nb5 is to
attack on the d6 square so that White gets a tempo to play 6.c4 and thus
dominates the d5 square permanently!} d6 {The main line of the Loewenthal
variation...} 6. c4 $1 {Basic idea behind this pawn formation for White is: (i)
to play a4, b4-b5 and if Black takes a6xb5, then White will re-take with c4xb5,
thus creating a passed pawn along the queen side; (ii) to place a knight on d5
followed by a pawn storm along the queen side and try to create a passed pawn
there. For this, White has to take a little care - he should avoid c5xd6 and
try to play c6 instead for creating a passed pawn on the queen side.} Be7 7.
N1c3 a6 (7... Be6 $6 {A strategic mistake without understanding White's plan...
} 8. Nd5 Rc8 $14 {White is now capable of playing Nbc3 in a direct way
whenever necessary, rather than through the long way via a3-b1, etc., as in
other similar variations of the Sicilian Defence, thus also saving lots of
tempo...}) 8. Na3 Be6 (8... f5 $5 {Most aggressive choice... but not free from
drawbacks. These are: (i) it weakens the light squares on Black's king side; 
(ii) it increases pawn islands in Black's position...} 9. exf5 Bxf5 10. Bd3 $5
(10. Be2 $5 {Practical choice, though not 100% correct; White's idea is to
play Bf3 and monitor the long diagonal...} Nf6 11. O-O O-O 12. Nc2 Rc8 13. Ne3

Back is left with some pressure along the b1-h7 and h3-c8 diagonals; White's
bishops have more freedom in comparison to Black.}) 11. Qxd3 Nb4 12. Qd1 Nf6
13. O-O O-O 14. Qb3 $36 {And Black is left with hanging pawns in a semi-open
'd' file... in contrast, White has a smaller pawn island and his knight aims
for e3 via c2.}) (8... Nf6 $6 {Strategic mistake, as now Black has no option
to play f5 or Bg5 for the time being...}) 9. Nc2 {Sensible move indeed...
improving the offside knight and preventing Black's possible Nd4 for the time
being; .also waiting to develop the light-squared bishop depending on how
circumstances unfold.} Rc8 (9... Bg5 $5 {Popular choice, already tried by many
titled players.} 10. Be2 $5 {... to take on g5 is also possible here.} Bxc1 (

plan is h3, Bf3 and Nd5, with better prospects. In contrast, Black has no
remarkable plan; all he can do is observe what White prepares next!}) 10. Nd5

chances due to the pawn majority on the queen side.}) 13. h4 {Necessary! It's
stopping the 'h' pawn march & Black's counterplay as well.} Qg6 (13... Qg4 14.

next plan is: (i) doubling the rooks along the 'd' file and playing Nd5 at a

queen side...} 1-0
