1.Rxf8+ {%03
 (It is a tactical position (the pieces are attacking each other), so we should
calculate the variations. To start the calculation we should realize all the
moves-candidates. And also we should calculate the forcing moves mainly. The
most forcing move - is check. So the first candidate-move is Rf8. Next forcing
move is capture. So next candidate-moves are Be5 and Qd7. The attacking moves
are also the forcing ones, but in this position white has no attacking moves
really. It means that in this position white should calculate: Rf8, Be5, Qd7.
If one of these moves will work good - white will do it. If all the forcing
moves are bad for white here - then we should start to calculate the simple (not forcing) moves.)}

Be5 black has 2 forcing answers, which we need to calculate: Be5 and Qb5)}

 It is the end of a forcing line and we should evaluate the final position.
White has a material advantage, so this should be winning, but it is not
completely winning. After calculation of the 3 moves-candidates we may make the
conclusion that Be5 is the strongest move, which wins the game.} 1-0

1.Rg7+ {%03
 (From the beginning of the calculation we should realize all the forcing
moves-candidates. The most forcing moves are checks: Qh7 and Rg7. We will
calculate them first. Then we should calculate captures: Rh7 and Be5.
IMPORTANT: We need to calculate the forcing moves first of all, but it doesn't
mean we will make the forcing moves all the time. We just need to check if one of them works in the current  position or not.)}

 It looks like you need to calculate a lot, if you are going to analyse all the
possible forcing moves. But it is not true. Most of the forcing moves are
completely wrong and you will spend only several seconds to realize it. In the
same time, using this way of thinking you will be able to find the powerful tactical ideas, which win the game, very often!}

 (Now black can make 2 moves: Kh7 and Qh7. It is very important to realize all
the moves-candidates FIRST. If you don't do this - you can forget about something in the future.)}
{%03(Black has a strong threat of Re1 mate, so white definitely need to make
something forcing. The forcing moves for white are: Qd4 and Rh7.)}

 White has the only forcing move Qf4 now, but it only could give a draw with
perpetual check. White has a material advantage (2 extra pawns), so white is
going to win the game. If the forcing moves don't work we can make the simple
move. In this position white, for example, can play Qc3 (to cover e1 square) and white has an advantage.}

1...Rxe4 {%03
(Black has 3 forcing moves-candidates, which we should calculate first: Rc7,
Re4, Be4. Also we can see that 2 black's bishops looks at the white's king. It
is one  of the typical tactical ideas - mate the king with 2 bishops. As you
can see it is easier for you to calculate the lines if you know the standard
tactical ideas. That's why it is useful to solve the tactical puzzles regularly
- it will keep your calculation skills in the good condition and  gives you the collection of typical ideas.)}

winning for white. And it make no reason for us to calculate other moves candidates here.}
