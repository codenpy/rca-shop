open the position to start an attack. In this position black already has some
open file on the queen-side. So it would be easier for black to attack there.
Then we need to realize how exactly we will use the pieces to realize our plan.
Black's rooks should be on the "a" and "b" lines. Bishop is on the good
position. Knight need to be transfered on the queen-side with a maneuveur Nd7-c5 or Nd7-e5-c4)}

the development and make the positional sacrifice of a pawn to open the lines for the attack.)}
