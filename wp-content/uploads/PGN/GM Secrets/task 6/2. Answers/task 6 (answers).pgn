long, because most of these moves-candidates are obviously bad. But we need to look quickly at every possibility.)}

 Once again I want to pay your attention on this idea: we usually need to
realize ALL the forcing candidate moves BEFORE starting to calculate the lines.
Otherwise you can forget about something. And while finding the candidate moves
you should think about every move for a second. Because it helps to realize which move you should calculate first.^013^010
