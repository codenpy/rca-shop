1.Nf5 {%02 (Black certainly has quite a lot of candidate moves. In the complecated
positions like this I recommend you to focus your attention on every single
piece every time, starting from the queen moves, then rook moves, bishop,
knight, pawns. In this case you will definitely find everything. The moves-candidates are: Qf5, Qb2, Rf5, Bf5, gf)}
{%03(After an opponent's move I strongly recommend you to ask yourself always "what
is an opponent's idea?" and "does he have any threats now?" It will help you to
prevent blunders.  Let's make this check in this position. Which attacking
moves black can make now? The forcing moves are: Bg4, Ne4, Qg3. First 2 moves
are not so dangerous, but Qg3 is a real threat, because after that black mate
white with Be5. So white should be careful and stop Qg3 move somehow. Now we
may start to think about the white's moves. As you know first we should think
about the forcing and attacking moves on the opponent's territory. The
moves-candidates are: Bd5, Nf5, Ne6, Nb5. Another idea is that we should
calculate THE MOST forcing moves first. So we should start the calculation from Nf5 and Ne6, then Bd5 and Nb5.)}
Qxb2 {%02 (now white has 2 forcing moves Rd8 and Bb2.)}
( 1...Qxf5 2.Rd8+ ( 2.Qxg7+ {%02 also works} Rxg7 3.Rd8+ Qf8
4.Rxf8# ) Rf8 3.Qxg7# ) ( 1...Rxf5 {%02 (white has 2 moves: Rd8 and Qe5. We should calculate the check first)}
2.Rd8+ Rf8 ( 2...Bf8 3.Qxe5+ Rxe5 4.Bxe5+ Kg8 5.Rxc8 $18 ) 3.Rxf8+
Bxf8 4.Qxe5+ $18 ) ( 1...gxf5 {%02 (same with Rf5)} 2.Rd8+ Rf8

3.Rd8+ Rf8 4.Rxf8# ) 3.Rd8+ Rf8 4.Rxf8# {%02 So this line is winning for white}
) Rf8 {%02 (again white has a choice from Rf8 and Bb2)}
( 2...Bf8 {?} 3.Bxb2+ Kg8 4.Nh6# ) 3.Rxf8+ ( 3.Bxb2 Rxd8 4.Bxg7+
Kg8 {%02 black has a material advantage} ) Bxf8 4.Bxb2+ Kg8 5.Bd5+
Be6 6.Bxe6+ Nxe6 {%02
 it is the end of the forcing line, now white has to move the knight back. So
we should evaluate the final position - it is equal.} {
 After all this calculation we can say that first move Nf5 is winning for white
in the line 1.Nf5-Qb2 2.Bb2   In the practical game white simply will make the
move Nf5 in this situation. But I recommend you to calculate other moves-candidates for white, just to have more practice.}

forcing moves candidates. They are: Rf7, dc, Bg6).)} Kxf7 {%02
 (now white has Qf3 and Bg6 moves-candidates. Qf1 is also check, but it is
quite same with Qf3 - no reason for us to calculate it: Qf3 is better according to the principle of maximum activity)}

piece, so we should calculate it first. Now black has no defense against Qf7 and white is winning)}
{Once again you can see that it is vey useful to use the base strategy principles (even during the calculation).}

 (As you know after an opponent's move we should ask ourselves "what is his
idea?" So we should start to find the forcing moves, which our opponent can
make. In this position, for example, black is threatening Rf1, following with
Qb1 with mate. It means white has no time for the simple moves, like Nd5 for
example. So realizing of an opponent's idea is very useful stuff. The
moves-candidates for white are Qf8, Qf7, Rf7, Ne8 and Ne6.)}

1.Rxe4 {%03
 (As usual, we should ask ourselves about an opponent's threats first. One of
the really typical mistakes - player starts to calculate one attractive line
and forgets about everything else. To find an opponent's threats we should
think about how he can bring his pieces on the our territory of the board. For
example, in this position black is threatening Rb1 and Nd2 fork. So the
possible moves-candidates for white are: Bf7, Nh6 and Re4.)}

move-candidate quickly first. Because probably it makes no sense for you to
calculate the one line too long if another one is winning simply.)} )

logical, then white will attack the single black's king with several pieces.)}

 (the moves candidates for white now are: Ne7, Nh6, Bf7, Qf6, Qh6. Finding all
the moves-candidates sometimes makes it obvious to decide which move is the
best. For example in this position Qf6 is winning simply, so we may not to calculate other lines.)}
