bishops. Principle of material - we need to keep the material.)}
e6 6.a3 {%02

maximum activity - we should use the PIECES first of all. The pawn moves in the
opening could be good only if they prepare the development of the pieces.)}

of the black's bishop, because force it to go back.)} Bb6 8.Bb2
{%02(Development of a piece. According to the principle of the least active piece
we should develop the knights before bishops. But into this position the
principle of flexibility works - bishop needs to be developed on the b2 anyway
(it was an idea of the moves a3 and b4) and then we can decide which square will be preferable for the knight: d2 or c3)}

Qxd4 16.Qe2 {%02
 (Principle of material - white is protecting the e5 pawn. The move Qe2 is a
move back, so it breaks the principle of maximum activity. But we did it due to
the concrete tactical reasons - it prepars the attack on the black's queen then.)}
Qh4 17.Rad1 {%02
 (Principle of the least active piece. Principle of maximum activity - the
rooks usualy most active on the open lines. Also limit the black's activity -
not allow black to play Bd7. It is an ideal situation if your move increase
your activity and decrease an opponent's activity in the same time)}

Qe7 22.Nf6+ {%02
 (Principle of the attack - white has a huge advantage in activity, that means
white should attack. To start an attack we need to make the moves on the
opponents territory. Also it is a forcing move. Also it helps to open the
position, what we need to do in order to start the direct attack.)}
