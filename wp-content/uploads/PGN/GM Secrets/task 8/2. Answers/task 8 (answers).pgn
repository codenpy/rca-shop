moves Qa8, Qe8 and Qf6 quickly. These moves looks bad, but anyway we should
check ALL the possible fircing moves. You will spend a little time on it, but
sometimes it will help you to find the winning move. IMPORTANT: you need to
turn off your critique! And look at ALL the forcing moves! In this position
these moves don't work.  Next we should calculate Rf5, Ng6, Nf7, Nf3.)}

 including of this check doesn't change something really, it is still bad for
white. When all the forcing moves don't work we should start to think about the
simple moves. Regarding to the simple moves - white need to move away the queen
and keep an attack on the f6 knight. So white can simply play Qd6} )

1.Nxe5+ {%03
 (Usually we should think about the position in general first, and then
calculate the concrete lines. But when you can see the contact between the
pieces (when they are attacking each other) - you should mainly calculate the
lines.  This position is certainly tactical. So we should start the
calculation. The candidate-moves for white here are: Qh5, Ne5, Nh6, Bc5. First
we will calculate checks, because they are the most forcing moves. Comparing
Qh5 and Ne5 we should analyze Ne5 first, once again - because it is the most
forcing move: after that black only can take the knight, while after Qh5 black
has a lot of possibilities. We are starting from the most forcing move, because it is the simplest way.)}
fxe5 {%02 (The moves-candidates now are Qd7 and Bc5. Comparing these 2 moves we should
calculate Bc5 move first, because it is the most logical move: white is winning
the material, intending to win the black's queen then.)} 2.Bxc5

 The conclusions: 1. We should calculate the most forcing and logical moves
first. 2. While finding the moves-candidates it makes sense to think about
every move for a second. It helps to realize which move looks the best, so you
will calculate it first. This will help you to save your time.} 1-0

1.Ng5 {%02 (black has 2 moves: Ng5 and fg)} {%03
 (The attacking moves are the best. That's why I recommend you to find the
attacking moves first of all. To make it - you need to focus your attention on
the opponent's territory of the board and think, how can you transfer your
pieces onto such territory and take something or attack something. This simple
idea will help you to find many powerful moves! You should think quickly about
every possible forcing move on the opponent's territory. Most of them will be
very bad, so you will not spend a lot of time.  In this position we should first analyze the moves: Nc8, Nd7, Ne5, Ng5.)}

pressure and only helps black. So white should play Bg5 or Bc4)}

2.Bg4 {%02 now black cannot do anything really. White will take back the knight on d7 saving a huge advantage in activity}

) Kh8 4.Be6 {%02 then white will take the knight d7 and the black's rook a7 is still out of game}
{As you can see in the hard tactical positions sometimes it is hard to calculate
all the lines. In this case we should use the general principles to realize
which moves should be good, so we will focus the attention mainly onto these moves.}

1.Qe6 {%02 (after this move white is winning in all the lines pretty simply)}
{%03(It is also an example on the topic: finding the moves-candidates. It is very
important TO TURN OFF YOU CRITIQUE on this stage of thinking. You need to think
for a second about EVERY forcing (and attacking) move on the opponent's
territory. One another important rule: in the hard positions (and in the simple
also :) it is easier to focus an attention on every SINGLE piece every time,
starting from queen moves, then rook moves, bishops, knights, pawns. For
example, in this position the first thing you should think about is: "which
forcing moves I can make with the queen on the black's territory". Then you
will find the winning move Qe6. And it will be the FIRST move, which you will
calculate really. While for all other players it will be the LAST move to think about :))}
