Bf1 Ng7 {Diagram #} 16. c5 $1 {We can see clearly that White has more space.
The space advantage give you the opportunity to maneuver your pieces or to
think more actively than your opponent. Similarly, White has all the pieces on
the board and this gives him an extra advantage because Black's pieces are a
little squeezed. White's pieces are active and he uses this activity by
opening up the position.} (16. e5 $5) (16. Qh6 $5) 16... d5 (16... Qc7 $2 17.

take advantage of Black's unprotected pieces.}) 17. exd5 exd5 18. b4 {White is
stabilizing the c5-pawn and, probably, he would like to play b5 in the
future.} b5 19. a4 a6 20. axb5 axb5 21. Ra1 $16 {White's pieces are more
active because they have more space to maneuver. The rooks are on the open
files and, a little later in the game, White managed to conquer the a-line.
Please also notice that Nc3 and Bf1 are flirting with the b5-pawn. It's a bad
idea to sacrifice a minor piece there in order to take two pawns and create
the passed c- and b-pawns. White has advantage here and he manages to win the
game afterwards.} Re8 22. Ra2 Qc8 23. Rea1 Qb7 24. Qb2 Ne6 25. Ra3 Nc7 26. Ra5

has more space and he is pressing the weakness on c7. Black's king is in
danger because the queen is standing on the long diagonal a1-h8. Please also
notice that thanks to his space advantage the bishop is standing extremely
well on e6 and it's helping White to control some squares around the enemy
king. For those reasons, White decides here to break up the position with the
fantastic e5 move.} (45. g4 $5) (45. Rc4 $5) (45. Kg2 $5) (45. Rec2 $5) (45. h4

not forcing and, for that reason, your computer cannot give you great hints
here. In similar cases, you should understand the main strategy, and try to
find a good plan. White has more space and he would like to maintain this main
advantage. Black has based his counterplay on the releasing d5 or b5 moves. In
the light of that, with the last move, White would like to prevent the b5
advantage.} (18. Qe2 $5 {It's always a good strategy to place your queen on

really strange-looking move, but the center is closed; so, Black cannot attack
us there. White's idea is to take space on the kingside and try to attack
there. He cannot gain more space in the center; so, he tries to gain space
with his pawns on the kingside. In the future, he can use this space in order
to organize his pieces and prepare the attack.} (12. O-O $5) (12. Be3 $5) (12.

In the king's Indian Defense, White can gain a lot of space, but Black would
like to counterattack in the enemy kingside. Please note that the center is
closed; so, the players should attack on the flanks. Usually, White would like
to attack on the queenside and perform the c5-break. On the other hand, Black
would like to play the g4-break and open the enemy's king position. Karjakin,
before making his main break, c5, takes more space on the queenside with the
pawns.} Ng6 15. a5 Rf7 16. Bf2 Bf8 17. Nb5 $5 {A very interesting maneuver.
