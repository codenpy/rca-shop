attack the enemy king. A lot of white pieces are looking at Black's kingside.
Right now, White is threatening checkmate on h8; so, he should defend himself.}

this active move before placing the bishop on e5. When you're puting a piece
actively in the center of the board, you don't like to allow your opponent to
kick it right in the next move. For that reason, White played this counterblow,
attacking the g5-bishop.} gxf3 (21... fxe5 22. fxg5 Qxg5 (22... exd4 23. Ne4

Black had other interesting options here, but this was a very fighting move!
Black sacrifices material in order to fully activate his pieces and create an
attack against the enemy king. Please notice that the combination of Qg5 and
Nf4 is fantastic.} (25... R6d7 $5) (25... Nxd3 $5) 26. Rxd3 Rxd3 27. Qb3 h5 $1
{Black's bishop is under attack on b7, but Black continues the game with a
counterblow. The g3-knight is pinned because Black's queen and knight are
attacking the g2-square. If the g3-knight is removed, then the Qg2 mate will
follow. The move which was played in the game is difficult and, if you like to
find similar moves, first of all, you should believe in your pieces. Please
also notice which square your pieces are coordinated in. And, last but not
least, you should follow your plan at any cost, insist on it and try to
promote your ideas.} 28. Qxb7 h4 29. Ne3 hxg3+ 30. fxg3 Nxh3 $1 {Both
sacrifices were correct; Black has completely opened White's position by
destroying the pawn cover. Similarly, he opened the c1-h6 diagonal in order to
capture the e3-knight.} (30... Nxg2 $1 31. Kxg2 Rxe3 $19) 31. Qc8+ Kg7 32. Ng4

The knight is a taboo because, if White accepts it, then Black will have
access to the h4-square with devastating consequences, as you can see in the
sub-variation. Black has a clear advantage here and a strong attack; so, he
manages to win the game afterwards.} 33. Ne3 (33. gxf4 Qh4+ 34. Kg1 Qxe1+ 35.

Black starts taking the initiative because White's king is not secure, the
e4-pawn is isolated and in the same color of the f1-bishop. The position is
about equal, but Black's chances are a little bit preferable because his
pieces are organized better and have better potentials. For example, he can
play b5 and b4, kicking out the c3-knight. The rooks can penetrate on f2 and
c8, and he can control the open files. After the big fight, Black manages to
