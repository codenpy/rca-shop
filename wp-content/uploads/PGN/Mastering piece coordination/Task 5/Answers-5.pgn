White has a clear advantage, but it's not obvious how he should continue.
Unfortunately, he cannot add more presure on d5. In similar situations, you
need to find the second weakness; and this is what Botvinnik is doing here.
Black's pieces are busy with the d5-pawn defense and he tries to transfer the
attack to the kingside.} (25. e4 $6 dxe4 26. Qxc5 bxc5 27. Rxd7 Rxd7 28. Rxd7

White has continued with his plan. He manages to open the g-line, and next, he
should transfer his heavy pieces there.} f6 28. Qg6 Bf7 29. Qg3 f5 30. Qg5 {
White's pieces are standing very actively, and both rooks can join the attack.
One rook can go to g1 and the other one to h4.} Qe6 31. Kh1 Qe5 32. Rg1 $16 {
White is attacking the weakness on d5 but, similarly, he is opening the g-line
in order to attack on the kingside. Please also note that the f5-square is
weak. Thus, White has a big advantage, and he manages to win the gameafterwards
