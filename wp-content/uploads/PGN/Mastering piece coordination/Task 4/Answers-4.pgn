This is a very typical move in this structure. White's idea is to force the
e6-bishop to go back or exchange it on c4. After that, the d5-square will be
weak. This is the first step of the plan in order to control better the center.
} Bc4 14. Bxc4 Qxc4 {Diagram #} 15. Bg5 {This is the second step of the plan.
White would like to exchange the last piece which is defending the d5-square
-the f6-knight. After this exchange happens in a moment, White will have the
superior piece -the c3-knight- against the passive e7-bishop.} Rfe8 16. Bxf6

to put your bishop in a good post, then you should put it on an open diagonal.
On the other hand, if you like to put your knight in an active square, then
you should put it in the center of the board in a hole. By hole I mean a
square which is not protected from the enemy pawns. In this particular
position, we can see that the d4-square is an excellent outpost for Black's
knight. On the other hand, the e2-bishop doesn't have a bright future. For
that reason, Black exchanged his bishop to activate the knight.} (18... Bf5 19.

c4-pawns are restricting the white bishop's activity, a factor which increases
Black's superiority. White started an attack on the kingside; however, without
queens, he cannot do anything realistic. Black can activate his rooks on the
f-line, but it's not obvious how White can play with them. For the above
mentioned ideas, Black has a better position and, fairly enough, he manages to
win the game afterwards.} 26. Kf1 a4 27. a3 c5 28. Rd2 b5 29. cxb5 Nxb5 30.

cannot activate his bishop from g2 and his pawns on f5 and e4; so, his
mobility is limited .} 31. Nxc5 Qxc5 32. f6 Nc7 {White is trying to create

a lot of good moves. He should select a good plan, and he did it in the game
by playing the Ba3 move. The idea is to exchange the key defender of the
d4-pawn and the c3-square. Black would like to blockade the c2-pawn and attack
it with his rooks.} (14... b5 $5) (14... g6 $5) (14... Bb4 $5) 15. Bxa3 Qxa3
16. c4 b6 {White manages to push this pawn on c4; however, it is under heavy
pressure. With this f4 move, White was dreaming to attack the kingside;
however, the light-squared bishop is missing and, for that reason, he cannot
perform a successful attack. Black is performing his powerful play by planning
in the area in which he is stronger, the queenside.} 17. g4 Qd6 18. Ne5 dxc4
