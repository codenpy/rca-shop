the isolated pawn in the center. Tarrasch used to say that anyone who is
afraid to play with the isolated pawn is afraid to play chess. I hope that you
are not in this category. ;-) The d4-isolated pawn gives White freedom and
more active pieces. White should be careful not to exchange his pieces because
this pawn will become weak. Alekhine chooses an active plan, and now the idea
is to play f5. Please note that the e7-bishop is not protected.} (17. Qf3 $5) (

the critical moment for White. White's position is preferable because he has a
better control in the center, a faster development and more potential plans.
Black's main disadvantage is the bad located light-squared bishop. Similarly,
Black loses some tempi by moving Ne4 and Nf6 back. After some thought, I chose
to capture on d5 because I was afraid that Black would capture on c4, and then,
he would play the liberating e5 move.} 12. cxd5 (12. Na4 Na5 $1 (12... dxc4 $6

White has a better position here with more active pieces. He dominates the

evaluate if his kingside structure is compromised before playing this move.
Similarly, the hanging pawns on c4 and d4 could look like weak, but they are
not. The b2-bishop is controlling the center better; it's a more preferable
piece here because it can coordinate better with the other pieces; and last
but not least, it can help the attack on the g7-pawn in the future.
Unfortunately, we cannot say the same thing for the d7-knight, am I right?} (
