for the center. He would like to open the lines and create more space for his

now because the center is closed.}) (9... Re8 $5 {This is another good move
which frees the f2-square for the bishop and prepares the e5 move a little
later.}) 10. Be2 (10. cxd5 exd4 11. exd4 Nxd5 12. Nxd5 cxd5 $11 {Black is here

structure because Black is fighting for the central d4-square to take it under
his control. The c3-knight and the c4-bishop cannot use it any more. Similarly,
White cannot use the weakened d6-square because it is very well controlled by
Back's dark-squared bishop, and White's pieces are not ready to conquer it.} (

double the rooks on the d-line and has a small advantage. Alekhine manages to
win the game afterwards. The game is very didactic, and I recommend you to
check it carefully! Later on, he manages to place his knight on f4 and, after
the exchange, he dominates the center with his centralized queen on e5.} 17. f3

e4, and then the c4-bishop; so, White should be careful. For that reason, he
moves his bishop from the danger square and is putting pressure against the
center. With his last move, he would like to remove one of the d4-square
defenders in order to play d4 by himself.} (10. Qc2 $2 Nxe4 $1) (10. Qb3 $6 a4)

practically, White here has a small plus thanks to his fantastic central

make Black's position more uncomfortable.} d5 14. e5 Ne4 15. Nxe4 {White took

d6-bishop is not very well protected. White starts an immediate combat with
the pieces. White's pieces are extremely in the center of the board, but we
cannot say the same for Black. Please also note that Black's king is not very
well placed on the g7-square. Black's fianchetto is not protecting the king
very well; the bishop should be on g7 in order to protect the dark-squares.} a6
