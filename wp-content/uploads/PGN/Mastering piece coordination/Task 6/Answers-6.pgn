typical move on the Closed Spanish. Black's ideas to free the c5-square and
possibly to use it with the knight in the future. Black's main problem here is
the dark-squared bishop because it is locked behind his pawns. For that reason,
Black has planned to create a weakness on e3 and then to attack it with the
bishop. Another possible idea is to maneuver the bishop to b6 via d8.} (12...

is "trapped" and his pawn structure will be destroyed.} 14. Ng3 Nxe3 15. fxe3

Black will relocate his bishop to the c1-h6 diagonal. Another idea behind this
move is to play h5 and h4, kicking away the g3-knight. Black has a big
advantage and he manages to win the game afterwards.} 16. Qe2 Nf6 17. Rf2 h5

You should remember this idea by heart! Before starting the attack, you need
to maneuver your pieces in the best positions. Please note that it's not
possible for Black to improve his pieces and, for that reason, White's
position can become better and better.} (31. b5 $5 axb5 32. cxb5 {This is a
variation; however, by exchanging the light-squared pawns, you're helping
Black to activate his light-squared bishop.}) 31... Kf7 32. c5 R6d7 33. Na5 {
This is another very instructive moment; White continues to improve the
position of his pieces. The knights have two very good squares on c5 and b6.

about similar maneuvers.} Rc7 38. Nac4 Bd7 39. Nd6+ {Thanks to his fantastic

because he's controlling the open e-line and his light pieces are more active.
More specifically, his g4-knight is creating problems around the enemy king.
White's queen is almost trapped, and Black finds a way to improve the position
of his bishop. This bishop will not only attack White's queen but, similarly,
it covers the g1-escape square from the opponent king.} (22... h5 $5) (22...
