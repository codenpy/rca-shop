$3 $18 {Usually, in the king's Indian Defense, Black is attacking on the
kingside and White on the other side of the board. However, White has a lot of
flexible plans. Earlier in the game, I chose to stop Black's initiative with
the f4 move. Some moves later, my opponent missed the g4 move and, in order to
complicate the game, he sacrificed a piece. Here is the critical moment for
White, and I have a lot of juicy continuations. First things first, we should
attack in the area in which we have more active pieces, and this is the
kingside. It seems that Black can capture the e3-bishop; however, this isn't
possible immediately because the f4-pawn is pinned! But we should be careful
because Black is threatening to give a check on g5 in order to unpin the rook,
and then, to capture the bishop. So now, we can come to the conclusion that
our king was standing on the way. Moreover, the g6-knight is unprotected and
in the same rank as the queen. These ideas and thinking process helped me find
the best move in this position, Kh1. I hope you did the same. :-)} (20. Bd2 $5

I used the technique which I learned on The Grandmaster's Secrets: calculate
first the most forcing moves with your strongest pieces! I sacrificed the

$5 {I think it's clear for you that you can still play on the queenside
because you have more space there and you can bring the pieces easier. Black
is better in this position because his light-squared bishop is better compared
with the e2-bishop which is hiden behind its own pawns. White cannot plan
actively in the kingside because he cannot bring his pieces easily there and
open lines. On the other hand, Black can make two possible breaks on c4 and a4.
The easiest way to play is to organize the a4 break. This is exactly what
Black did in the game.} (20... a5 $5) (20... Nb5 $5) (20... Qd7 $5) 21. Nh4 (
