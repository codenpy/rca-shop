1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 d6 5. c3 f5 {(Black wants to create an
unbalanced position)} 6. exf5 Bxf5 7. O-O Bd3 8. Re1 Be7 9. Qb3 b5 $1 {(We
should try to attack always, but in unbalanced positions it becomes extremely
important)} 10. Qd5 bxa4 $5 {(Though it's a risky decision, black keeps
playing maximally aggressively.)} 11. Qxd3 $2 {(When you play boldly, it often
confuses your opponent. Then he starts making mistakes)} (11. Qxc6+ $1 Kf8 12.
Nd4 exd4 13. Qf3+ Nf6 14. Qxd3 {gives white an advantage due to black's
numerous weaknesses}) 11... Nf6 12. Qc4 Qd7 13. Qxa4 $6 {(White makes a lot of
moves by his queen and ignores other pieces. In complicated positions an
initiative (not a material!) becomes the key factor.)} O-O 14. d3 Nd4 $1 {(We
should make forcing moves on the opponent's territory. Now white has to pay
for his previous mistakes and undeveloped position.)} 15. Qd1 (15. Qxd7 Nxf3+
16. gxf3 Nxd7 17. Kg2 Nc5 {and black saves an attack even in an endgame}) 15...
Nxf3+ 16. Qxf3 d5 $1 {(In order to start a direct attack, we need to open a
position first. We can do it by making pawn moves or positional sacrifices.
Here black is using both methods together.)} 17. Rxe5 $2 Bd6 {(The positional
sacrifice gave black a new b8-h2 diagonal for his bishop and the e-file for
his rook. Of course it's more than enough for just a pawn)} 18. Rf5 Ng4 $1 {
(We should focus attention on the opponent's territory and we need to consider
all the attacking moves there (including the moves which seems impossible))}
19. Qxg4 (19. Rxf8+ Rxf8 $19 {ALL the black's pieces are fighting against
white's lonely queen}) 19... Rxf5 20. Be3 Re8 $1 {(Black is creating problems
for white by his every move)} 21. h3 (21. Nd2 $2 Rxe3 22. fxe3 Rf1+ 23. Rxf1
Qxg4 $19) 21... h5 22. Qd1 Rxe3 {(This positional sacrifice eliminates the
only developed piece and creates weaknesses around the white's king)} 23. fxe3
Qe7 24. Nd2 Qxe3+ 25. Kh1 Qg3 26. Qg1 Rf2 27. Rd1 g5 28. Nf1 Qf4 29. Nh2 g4 $5
(29... Rxb2 $1 {in addition to black's attack he will gain a material
advantage. This will guarantee a simple win}) 30. hxg4 hxg4 {It's very
interesting that white resigned in unclear position!! After 31.g3 everything
is not that simple for black.   Do you know why white player (2400+ player)
didn't find 31.g3 move? It's because black was pressuring white's position
during the whole game. Black disheartened White and gained a victory!} 0-1

1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. cxd5 cxd5 5. Bf4 Nc6 6. e3 a6 7. Rc1 Bg4 8. f3
Bc8 {(The pawn structure is symmetric and white needs to complicate the
position somehow (if he wants to win!))} 9. g4 $1 {(Objectively it's not the
best move. However, it makes the position unbalanced and creates problems for
black)} g6 $6 {(Black makes a mistake right away! It often happens when you
pressure an opponent)} 10. h4 {(After the black's move g6 white got some real
attacking chances.)} h6 11. Qd2 $1 {(a very interesting and creative idea!)}
Bg7 12. Qh2 {(White wants to attack the black's queen-side weaknesses also.
Additionally the queen may work on the h-file if it be opened somewhen later)}
e6 $2 {(Black has the weak squares b6 and c7; after the e6 move all the dark
squares became weak.)} ({it's was better to play a normal development move}

and Nb6}) 14. a3 {(We should mainly attack opponent's weaknesses. They are the
easiest targets for our attack. Now white is going to transfer the knight to
b6)} g5 $2 {(Black is making one more mistake)} 15. Bd6 Qd8 16. hxg5 Ng8 (16...
hxg5 $2 17. Qxh8+ Bxh8 18. Rxh8+ Kd7 19. Rxd8+ $18) 17. g6 $1 {(This
positional sacrifice keeps the black's king-side pieces out of game. In
unbalanced positions we should mainly keep an initiative!)} fxg6 18. Bd3 Nge7
19. Nge2 Kf7 20. Bc7 Qd7 21. Bb6 $6 (21. Na4 $1 {was very powerful}) 21... e5
22. Bc5 Re8 {(The black's task is very hard, because he has to care about all
the white's attacking possibilities)} 23. Bxe7 Qxe7 24. Nxd5 Qd8 {(Since Qd5
is not a threat, white should keep attacking!)} 25. g5 $1 {(A positional
sacrifice of a pawn is a pretty standard way to open lines and diagonals for
your pieces. Such sacrifices are nearly always correct.)} Rh8 (25... hxg5 $2

will win easily in all the variations)} 30. Qf4 Ke7 31. Nh7 Rxh7 32. Qf7+ Kd6
