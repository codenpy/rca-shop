1. d4 e6 2. g3 c5 3. Nf3 cxd4 4. Bg2 e5 $6 {(It breaks the principle of
maximum activity: black made the second move of 1 piece in an opening; and
it's a pawn move instead of a piece move.)} 5. O-O d6 $2 {(Black is breaking
the same principle again!)} ({Of course a piece move is better} 5... Nc6) 6. c3

the less active square than c6 and it closes the bishop's diagonal. Thus black
broke the principles of maximum activity and harmony.)} ({better was} 9... Nc6)
10. Nc4 Qc7 $2 {(A development of a queen is the last opening task. We should
not develop it too early because it can be an object of an attack for
opponent's minor pieces.)} (10... h6 $1 {(principle of an attack - attacking
moves are always the best)}) 11. b3 h6 {? (Though it's an attacking move, but
it doesn't work. We should be very careful with pawn moves in an opening,
because often they don't support our development.)} (11... O-O {The black's
