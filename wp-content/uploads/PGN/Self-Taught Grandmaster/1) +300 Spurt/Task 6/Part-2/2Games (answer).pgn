Nc6 9. f4 exf4 $2 {(black removes a tension and activates the white's bishop)}

11... a5 $2 {(We should activate our pieces first of all. A pawn move a5
doesn't do anything and ignores development)} ({better was} 11... Be7) 12. Nf3
{(After an opponenet's mistake we may and should attack. Right now white is
attacking the d4 pawn)} Bxc4 13. Rc1 $1 {(principle of time - we should attack
quickly and should bring more pieces in a game with tempos)} Bd5 14. Nfxd4 {
(Black has only a few developed pieces. If white exchanges them - black will
have no pieces in the game at all)} Bxg2 15. Kxg2 Qd5+ 16. e4 $1 {(An attacked
should open a position by making pawn moves in a center)} Nxe4 17. Nxc6 bxc6
18. Qf3 Nf6 {(Now we can clearly see a situation where white uses all his
pieces, while black only 2. Of course it will be simple for white to gain a
victory in any variation)} 19. Rxc6 (19. Nd4 $1) 19... Bb4 20. a3 Be7 21. Re1
Qxf3+ 22. Kxf3 Nd5 23. Rc5 {(White keeps attacking by every move)} Nxf4 24.

{(White has finished the main opening tasks and now it's time for an attack.
White has even more reasons to play aggressively because black didn't develop
his queen-side pieces yet.)} 13. Bh6 $1 {(In order to start an attack we
should move the pieces forward on an opponent's territory)} Qxd4 14. Qg5 $1 {
(We should attack quickly making each move with a threat)} Qxe5 15. Rhe1 {(An
attacker can bring more pieces in a game with tempos, while a defender has to
react on white's threats)} Qf6 16. Bxg7 {(forcing move)} Qxg5+ 17. Nxg5 Kxg7
18. Rxe7+ $1 {(even if this move is not the best objectively, it will bring
great practical result for sure. Tight defense is a hard task and most players
can't do it well)} Kf6 19. Rxh7 Kxg5 20. Rd6 {(now the black's king is almost
captured. White is going to play g3 and h4.)} Bg8 21. h4+ Kf4 22. Rxb7 {(This
not only captures a pawn, but also not allows black to develop his knight)} Bc4
23. Re7 {(White is still keeping the king in a cage)} Na6 ({computer suggests} 
23... Rc8 {but it's a hard move for a human. The black's position is still
hard in any case.}) 24. b3 Bf1 25. Nd5+ Kg3 26. Rxg6+ {(White keeps making
forcing moves all the time)} Kf2 $2 {fatal mistake} (26... Kh2 {avoided an
immediate loss}) 27. Nf4 {(White threatens Nh3 and black has no sufficient
defense)} Bxg2 (27... Kg1 28. Re1) 28. Nd3+ Kxf3 29. Ne1+ Kf2 30. Rxg2+ Kf1 31.
Ree2 {It's the 31st move and the a8 rook is still there...} 1-0
