{An opening stage is almost finished, the position is quite static, so it's
time to compose a middlegame plan. First we should choose a direction of an
attack. White has weaknesses on the queen-side and the weakest point is the c4
pawn. Next we should think about the best squares for our pieces to realize
this plan. The a6-rook can go to c8 and after c5 it will pressure the c4 and
c3 pawns. The d7-bishop may go to e6 or a6. The c6 knight will be certainly
placed on a5.} 12... Rc8 13. Bb2 Na5 14. Qe2 c5 {(this also helps black to fix
the weaknesses)} 15. Rfc1 Qc7 16. d5 Rce8 {(Black is giving the c8 square for
