1. e4 {Lovro Glavina: "Hey Igor ! I am an active member of the comments-giving
feedback and showing interest in the courses even when you dont give any
offers, so maybe I could get some extra credit so that you analyze my game? :D
Cuz you know, you dont get a lot of comments and then you get a lot of them
when there's some offer like your analysis. I don't want to seem childish, but
it's dissapointing when you comment on a lot of games and then you don't get
any credit(the analysis of Smirnov) for it when some offer is created and when
then lots of people paste their games... Its not my game but one of my
friends', and we're having a discussion(he's a 1685 fide and his opponent is
2200). He says that he lost because he didnt know theory. He couldn't find a5
without theory instead of 9... Nd4. Also, he says that it was extremely
difficult to realize with calculation that 13..d5 instead of 13.. d6 was much
better. What I'm trying to tell to him, is that he still didn't manage to
understand some of your principles. What do you think?"} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4

this move because you can learn it more easy.}) 5. Nb3 Bb6 6. Nc3 Nf6 7. Qe2

for Black. He has a lot of interesting options but before start making
different decisions, let's understand the position. White is little better,
thanks to his space advantage and more active pieces. We are in the opening,
so Black needs to develop the rest of his army. In the light of that the move
Re8 and d6 comes into my mind first. The move a5 looks the most popular move
acording to the megadatabase, however it is not the most logical move. Black
cannot really attack to the Queenside. White can easily stop this attack with
the a4 move and after that Black cannot open lines there, because he doesn't
have pawn breaks.} 10. a4 Nd4 {Not forced, but attractive. But I am not sure

"break the stereotypes". You will learn a lot of things for the pin. ;-)}) 13.
f4 d6 14. Be2 g5 $2 {He cracked under the pressure. This is not a good move at
all. We should not open lines in the position where we are under attack. In a
chess game we are fighting to put our pieces in his maximum activity. The pin
is limited our pieces mobility. Thus, we need to unpin when we have the
oportunity. On the other hand, Black tried to use tactics, but tactics are
working good for the side which has a better and more active position. Thus,
after some forcing moves Black end up with a piece down and he lose the game.}

you to study the course "mastering the Grunfeld as Black pieces". This is a
course on how to play as Black, but you can understand better the lines and
what are the Black's plans. Then you can play better as white as well!
Similarly, if you would like to understand better the situation then you need
to play some times this position with the Black pieces. The last move, Be2 is
not good. Perhaps White would like to prevent the pin on g4. If this is the
point then he should play Bc4 and Ne2! In this way he can avoid the pin with
the pawn push to f3.} (7. Bc4) 7... Bg7 8. Be3 Nc6 9. Bb5 (9. Nf3 $5 Bg4 10. e5

squares around him are weak. Black can play Rg4 and f4 or he can try h5 - h4.
