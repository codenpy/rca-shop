a small advantage because he started an attack on the queenside. Black is
waiting passively and he tries to hold the position. I hope that you can
calculate correctly the series of forcing exchanges which may give White a
clear advantage.} Rxc7 (17... Nxc7 18. Nc5 $16 {
White threatens the d7-Bishop and the b7-pawn.}) 18. cxd5 cxd5 19. Bxa6 Rxc1+
20. Rxc1 bxa6 21. Rc7 $16 {Here White has a clear advantage because the a7-
and a6-pawns are doubled. Indeed, White also has doubled pawns on the b-line,
but the d2-knight is offering a fantastic protection to them. White's rook is
extremely active because it's pressing the a7-pawn and also everything on the
7th rank.} Bxa4 22. bxa4 e5 23. dxe5 Bxe5 24. Rb7 {White's advantage is
obvious because Black has two weaknesses, the a-pawns and d5.} Rb8 25. Rxa7 Rb6

$1 {Black is better because the pawn on e4 is weak and he has two connected
passed pawns on the queenside. In this position, Black has a clear plan, to
push the a-pawn and attack on e4. White has to defend in two points: he should
blockade Black's queenside pawns and also defend his weakness on e4, and maybe,
on g4. White should try to keep all the pieces on the board in order to
complicate the position: This strategy can give him the best practical chances.

because he controls the open e-line. Black doesn't have any particular
weakness, but his pieces cannot find active spots. So, the plan is to transfer
the position to the endgame, by exchanging the queens, in order to enter
Black's camp. White sacrifices a pawn to create weaknesses on Black's camp.} (

ced to capture on h4 because White was threatening h5. The e7-bishop is now
very well protected, so White would like to destroy Black's pieces
coordination.} Rf7 26. Qe6 Qxe6 27. Rxe6 {Black has at least two weaknesses.
The main weaknesses are on f6 and d5, thus it is difficult for Black to defend.

Black's pieces are defending them successfully, but they are tied to defend
very passively. White would like to create an outside passed pawn. So, he
manages to win the game at the end.} Kg7 30. bxa5 bxa5 31. Ra6 c6 32. Rxc6 Kg6
