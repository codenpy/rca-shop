Diagram #} Re8 {Black has more space in the center and a fantastic square on
d5 from which he can enter White's camp. On the other hand, White has more
space on the queenside, but he cannot use it because he cannot enter Black's
space or he cannot make a breakthrough.} (27... Kg7 $5 {He would like to bring
the king to the center, while avoiding a check from the knight. Thus, it
wasn't acurate to play Kf7.}) 28. Nb6 Nxb6 29. axb6 Rad8 {Black has a small,
but stable advantage now because White cannot complicate the game and Black
has a clear plan: to enter White's camp via the d5-square.} 30. Rc5 Kf7 31.
Rbc3 Re7 $1 {A very nice move because Black will have the option to re-capture
with the rook on d5 and not only with the pawn. By capturing with the rook,
the d5-square will be open.} 32. h4 Red7 33. Kf1 Rd5 34. Ke2 Ke6 35. Rxd5 cxd5

the b4-pawn. In any case, Black won the game afterwards.} (35... Rxd5 $1 36.

White has a little more space and, for that reason, we can claim that he has a
small advantage. With his last move, b4, he increases his space advantage.
Similarly, he would like to open one file on the queenside in order to enter
with his rooks.} (32. Nd4 $5) 32... Na4 33. Rb3 Rc7 34. g4 $5 {White wins more
space on the kingside and stops any possible breakthroughs which Black may
think or try. White's plan is to double the rooks on the d-line and transfer
the knight to f5 via d4. White has the advantage because he has more space and
he can press the weakness on d6.} h6 35. Rd2 axb4 36. axb4 b5 37. c5 $5 {
White's advantage could have been bigger if he had captured on b5; however,
the move which he played in the game was also good. White won the game
afterwards.} (37. cxb5 cxb5 38. Nd4 $16) 37... Rcd7 38. Rbd3 d5 39. exd5 Rxd5
