advantage because of the weak f6-pawn. White should look for the salvation
with her king activation to h5. Black has one weakness on h6-pawn, so White
should press it. Of course, the other two pawns, a7 and c6, are weaknesses,
but White cannot attack them. Black has the advantage here.} (30... Nxd3 $5 {
