also controls the very important c2-square, so Black's rooks cannot enter
White's camp easily. I hope that you have found the best continuation of

coordinated. The knight continues to make a perfect work on the e3-square.

now Black has to activate the only piece which is out of the game, the a8-rook.
Black would like to place this rook on b4 in order to press both b-pawns.
White unfortunately doesn't have an active counterplay, and therefore, Black
has a small but a stable advantage and a good plan to follow.} 26. Ra4 Rc4 {
Black is happy to exchange a pair of rooks because White's counterplay will be
less active after that. If there is only one pair of rooks on the board, then
Black's king can activate itself and run to the b-line. I'll repeat myself
again, this king will be working excelently with his friendly and enemy pawns;
i.e. it can protect its friends and attack the enemies.} 27. Rea1 Rxa4 28. Rxa4

rooks because the bishop is a better piece in the endgame and the weaknesses

is desperate with creating counterplay and, for that reason, he rejects the
exchange of the rooks.} 32. Re3 Rb4 33. Rd3+ Kc5 34. Rd2 Rd4 $1 {Again, the e

The position is complicated because there are a lot of pawns and pieces on the
board, but we can claim that Black has a small advantage. Why did we evaluate
the position in this way? Because the b3-pawn is passed and very strong. White
has a very good control over the center, but the passed b3-pawn creates huge
problems for him. Black could capture on e3 and then on e5, but White would
eliminate the b3-pawn and, after that, it will be almost imposibe to win the
game. Black's a5 is a prophylactic move which stops rook to b4. Thus, Black
protects his pawn.} (24... Rxe3 25. Rb4 Rxe5 26. R1xb3 $11) 25. Kf2 Rb8 26. Bc6

34. Be2 Rd8 35. Bc4 {Diagram #} f5 $1 {This is a very strong move because the
knight must retreat. After that, Black will destroy White's pawn structure.}
36. Nc3 Nxc4 37. bxc4 Rd3 {Usually, the bishop is stronger than the knight;
Black has very active pieces and the knight doesn't have good squares to go.
For all this, Black has a better position.} 38. Ne2 Ra3 {The a-pawn is doomed.}
39. g4 $5 {This was an interesting sacrifice in order to activate the knight,
but he is two pawns down. Black's position is technically winning.} fxg4 40.
Ng3 Rxa4 41. Ne4 Ra1 $19 {Black's a-pawn is very strong and White cannot
blockade it, so Black won the game afterwards.} 42. f3 gxf3+ 43. Kxf3 a5 44.
