White's king, which is still in the center.} (9... Re8 $5) (9... b6 $5) 10.

When you are attacking the enemy king, it is very important to keep the queens
on the board . This is a very basic strategic rule.} 13. Qb5 Bd7 14. Rc1 Nb4

21. Bc3 f5 $1 {White played well and defended tenaciously in the midlegame. He
has managed to exchange queens and this is in his own favor. But it costs him
the Exchange, and this is definitely one of Black's big advantages. However,
the danger has not gone yet and Fischer has found another cool way to blow up
the position.} 22. e5 Rc5 23. Nb4 Ba5 24. a3 Bxb4 25. axb4 Rd5 26. Ke2 $17 {
Fischer has a big advantage and he manages to win the full point.} Kf7 27. h4

9. c4 {White sacrifices a pawn in order to blow up the position. This is a
general strategic rule which you need to remember.} bxc4 10. Bxc4 Bxe4 11. O-O
{Black's king feels safe for the moment, but White has an advantage in
development and opens lines for his pieces. Thus, we can say that White has a
good compensation for the sacrificed pawn.} d5 12. Re1 e5 (12... dxc4 13. Rxe4

The strong threat here is that rook takes e7. White has a big advantage.}) 13.

the center. The material is not so important because Black's rooks at the
corners cannot help Black's king.} dxe4 15. Nf5 Bc5 16. Ng7+ {This is an
ant idea in order to take away the oportunity for Black's king to castle. We
know, by the chess rules, that it is impossible to castle if your king has
moved previously during the game.} Ke7 17. Nf5+ Ke8 18. Be3 Bxe3 19. fxe3 Qb6

10. f4 {We have finished the opening stage. Now it is time to find or to
create new weaknesses on Black's camp. the middlegame is the most fascinating
part of the game because we can attack the enemy king and this is what Fischer
would like to do. However, he needs to control totally the center first. For
that reason, he pushed his f-pawn in order to attack on e6 and create squares
for his pieces.} Qc8 11. f5 {He puts great pressure on the e6-pawn and if
Black push it to e5, then the d5-square will be very weak.} Nxd4 12. Bxd4 exf5
13. Qd3 fxe4 14. Nxe4 Nxe4 15. Qxe4 Be6 {Indeed, Black is a pawn up, but right
now, this extra d6-pawn is only limiting Black's pieces activity. In order to
use his extra pawn, Black needs to enter the endgame, but that is far away
from happening in this particular position. Fischer manages to win the game
afterwards.} 16. Rf3 Qc6 17. Re1 Qxe4 18. Rxe4 d5 19. Rg3 g6 20. Bxd5 Bd6 21.

13. a5 {Black's queenside position looks very firm because of the solid pawn
structure. Thus, Fischer should do something about that. The most logical move
is to break that structure with the a5-move.} c4 14. axb6 $1 {No time for it!
He sacrificed a piece in order to blow up Black's kingside position. I hope
that you had foreseen this idea before deciding to play a5. Fischer had seen
it for sure.} cxb3 15. Rxa6 Ne7 16. Ra8+ Kb7 17. Ra7+ Kb8 18. Nd5 {White's b6-p
awn is super powerful and participates very actively on the attack. The rook,
the pawn and the knight can create a lot of threats.} Nxd5 19. exd5 Bc8 20.
