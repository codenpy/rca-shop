22... Raf8 $5 {Here Black has some interesting options. In the King's Indian
Defense, it is important to attack on the kingside. For that reason, Fischer
is not caring about the open b-line. He tries to open lines on the kingside.
He should push the pawns in order to do that.} (22... Ng6 $5) 23. Rb6 Bc8 {
Another very nice move! Black controls the b7-square, making it imposible for
White to enter Black's position.} 24. Ne2 f4 25. Be4 Nf5 26. Rc6 Qg7 {
Everything is prepared step by step. The queen moves like the rook, so it is
also important to place her in the open lines. To place the queen opposite to
the king is another tip.} 27. Rb1 Nh4 $1 {White's position is extremely
critical now. The only move which could keep White in the game is g3. Black
has a lot of ideas: He can play f3, or he can sacrifice on g2, and then play
f3. You may wonder why this happened. This happened because White didn't
create any problems to Black in the previous moves and he didn't manage to
find an active plan.} 28. Qd3 Bf5 29. Kh1 (29. Bxf5 $4 Qxg2#) 29... f3 $1 $19 {
Black has a winning position now. You may like to see the rest of this

9. Bf4 $1 {In the opening, it is necessary to develop our pieces, and this is
exactly what Fischer does. Similarly, he is threatening the d6-pawn. Yes,
Black can capture the pawn on b2, but White's original idea was to open the
b-line for his rook. The conclusion is that Black can capture the pawn, but it
is a dangerous decision to make. Please, notice that Black won't be losing by
force, but, in practice, it will be very difficult for Black to play after
that.} Qxb2 10. Qd3 Qb4 11. Rab1 Qc5 12. Rfd1 {Black has one pawn and White

White is better here, but Fischer has very active pieces. White's rooks don't
have an open line to play on and Black is controlling the only one, the c-line.

that Black continues having awesome and active pieces; especially, Black's
knight on f4 is a monster. If Fischer claims that his f4-knight is better and
stronger than any of White's rooks, then I agree with him. :-) The position is
much more complicated due to the presence of opposite-color bishops. The side
which has the attack will be better, it is like to play with a piece up. In
this particular position, it's only Black who can create attacking threats.

16. Bxc4 $5 {It is always important to eliminate your opponent's active pieces.
Please, notice that White captured the knight with the bad d3-bishop. Black is
forced to create a weakness for himself, by capturing with the pawn. In the
next step, White will transfer his rook to c3, via the e3-square.} bxc4 17. Re3

19... Bg4 $5 {Wow, what a blow! Such tactical sacrifices are very unpleasant
surprises for all levels of players. Fischer's idea was to open the h-line in
order to continue his attack. This is not the best move objectively, but it's
extremely difficult for White to find the best defensive moves. The position
is wild and complicated.} (19... Rab8 $5 {
This is interesting in order to stop White's a6-threat.}) (19... Nf3+ $1 20.

Black has a very brutal and clear plan: to check mate White's king by using
the h-line. The only thing that White can do is try to distract Black from his
original plan.} Nf3+ 22. Bxf3 gxf3 23. axb7 Qxb7 24. Ng2 $5 {This is an
computer move which seeks to shut down the h-line. Of course, the game was
played before the computer era and it was very difficult to have foreseen this
in the game.} Kg7 25. Nh4) 21... Nf3+ 22. Bxf3 gxf3 23. Kg1 Bxf4 24. exf4 Kg7
