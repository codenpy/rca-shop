22. Ra3 {Fischer prepares the doubling of the rooks on the a-line. For that
reason, he makes room for the other rook on a1.} Ndf6 23. Rea1 Qd7 24. R1a2 {
This is Alekhine's gun, i.e. two rooks and the queen on the same file. In that
setup, the most common place for the queen is behind the rooks because it is
the most vulnerable piece.} Rfc8 25. Qc1 Bf8 26. Qa1 {
White has the advantage on the a-line because he can open it whenever he wants.
} Qe8 27. Nf1 $1 {A very strong idea: White would like to transfer this knight
to b1, then open the a-line and be on time to play Na3 to attack the b5-pawn.
You can see this idea clearly in the sub-variation.} Be7 28. N1d2 Kg7 29. Nb1
