any cost. He had a very fighting spirit and, because of that, he was ready to
complicate the game at every turn. His move was objectively wrong and he took

pawns.} (29... Ke7 30. h3 e5 31. -- Ke6 $11) 30. g3 h5 31. Ke2 h4 32. Kf3 Ke7 (

control the square in front of the isolated pawn. For that reason, Fischer

structure: This is a typical Sicilian Najdorf's pawn structure. It's true that
Black has the bishop pair and, in general, this is an advantage. However, the
center is closed and it was very important to have played f5 in order to shut
down everything. If or when Black moves the e-pawn, then White will have a
juicy square on d5 for his knight.} Kd8 23. Ka1 {
