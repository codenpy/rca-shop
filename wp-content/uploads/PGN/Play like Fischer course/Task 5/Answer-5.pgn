Fischer runs in this direction. The b7-square is perfectly safe.} 20. Nc6+ Kc8

impossible to castle. Here, White cannot castle short. At the same time, he
cannot castle on the queenside because the a1-pawn will be hanging. Having
said that, it seems that White's king is in great danger. Thus, we need to get
