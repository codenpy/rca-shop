27. b3 $1 {The position is almost equal. Black has doubled pawns on the e-line,
but the e6-pawn is restricting the activity of the e3-knight. Black's queen is
more active in the open line. White needs to activate his pieces. We know from
the video lesson that the bishop needs to have open diagonals and, for that
reason, White tries to open one for it.} cxb3 28. Bxb3 Nf8 (28... Nxe4 $2 29.
Qg4 $1 $18 {This is a very strong blow and, because of that, Black cannot
capture the pawn on e4.}) 29. c4 {Again, we see the same technique. White is
opening the diagonal for the bishop. He exchanges the weak c3-pawn with the
healthy b5-pawn. After that, the mobility of the bishop will be even better.
The a6-pawn will be weak and White could attack it in the future with the
bishop or queen.} Qd7 30. Qc2 Qb7 31. cxb5 axb5 32. Ng4 N6d7 (32... Nxe4 33.
Nxe5 $14) 33. Qd3 {Comparing this position with the starting one, we can see
that White's pieces activity is tremendous! They are controlling more space
and they are attacking Black's weak pawns. The pressure is very big and, for
that reason, Black made a mistake and lost the game. This happens very often
in the practical games.} Qc6 34. Qe3 Kf7 35. Nxe5+ Nxe5 36. Qf4+ 1-0

could have played Kg2, but Fischer has reserved this square for his bishop.
Black doesn't have an attack here because the knight cannot go to g4. The
queen alone cannot checkmate White's king. The bishop will be extremely active
on the long diagonal h1-a8. It can defend his king and, at the same time, put
pressure on the weak c6-pawn.} Qxh3 14. Nd2 Rad8 15. Bg2 {The bishop is
covering White's king, and also is now controlling the long diagonal.} Qf5 16.

18... Bd8 $1 {The bishop was blocked by Black's pawns and, therefore, Black
transfers the bishop to an open diagonal. This is a very important bishop's
manouver in the Sicilian Defense. Black should take care of his d6-pawn; but
if he has time, then he definitely may activate the bishop by placing it in
front of the pawns.} 19. a4 Bb6 {Now the bishop+queen battery is ready to
cause some troubles for White's king. Also, the bishop is covering the
a7-square, so that White's rook can't go there in the future.} 20. axb5 axb5

20... c5 $1 {Black is willing to sacrifice a pawn in order to activate his
bishop. In addition to that, Black is dreaming to jump with the knight to e4
for a double attack. The b7-bishop is open and active. If we compare the
f6-knigth with the a3-bishop, we can see that the knight is far more active
that this bishop. Am I right?} 21. dxc5 Bxf3 22. gxf3 Rxd2 23. Qxd2 Rd8 $17 {
Black didn't manage to create a doube attack, but he controls the open d-line.

11... Ng4 $5 {The most popular and perhaps the strongest move here according
to the database and the computer is b6. However, Fischer's move, Ng4, is also

dark-squared bishop.} 15. cxd5 Bxe5 16. f4 Bd4+ {Usually, the g-7bishop is the
worst piece in the King's Indian Defense. We can see that, after some moves,

18... Bh6 $1 {Black's position is a little cramped because the c5-knight is
pinned. White has more space and he also has the possibility to dominate

White's attack. Similarly, he's controlling the long diagonal a1-h8. Now he is

knight. Black's future plan is to play b5 in order to activate the b7-bishop.}
