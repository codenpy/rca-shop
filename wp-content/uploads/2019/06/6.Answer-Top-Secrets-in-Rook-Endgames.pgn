weakness from strategical endgames or even from the middlegame. This is what
White would like to create here, the second weakness. We can see a weakness on
d7; however, it's extremely difficult to attack it because our c5-pawn is
under attack as well. In the light of that, White cannot organize a successful
attack against d7. However, he would like to create the second weakness on a5;
so, he played a3.} bxa3 38. Qxa3 Rb7 39. R2c3 Kf7 40. h5 {We have the queens
on the board; however, Black's queen cannot enter White's position and, for
that reason, it cannot create any problems to White. White's player continue
grabbing more space and he's hoping to fix (to immobilize) one of Black's
pawns, probably on h7.} Ra7 41. Kf2 Ke8 42. Qa4 {This is a fantastic exchange
offer and, if Black accept it, then White's king can run easily on c4 or a4.
Similarly, you may imagine that Black's king doesn't have a great future; so,
White will have a clear advantage after the exchange of queens.} Qa6 {Diagram #

Black accepts the exchange of the pawns, then the rook can enter Black's camp.}

pawn, then you should keep the pieces on the board. White has a lot of good
options here, but the most straightforward -to exchange on d4- is the best
practical choice.} (13. Rad1 $5) (13. Rfd1 $5) (13. Nf4 $5) 13... Bxd4 14. Rad1

weaknesses on Black's position and, after that, it will be much easier to
attack them.} gxf6 {Diagram #} 17. Rfe1 $5 {Probably, it would be better to
double the rooks on the d-line; however, the move on the game was also good.} (

attack them with your heavy pieces.} Bxf5 27. Qxd6 Rxd6 28. exf5 gxf5 29. Rxf5

point, White has almost a winning advantage because Black cannot create easily
the passed pawn on the kingside; and on the other side of the board, on the
queenside, White has a pawn majority; so he can create a passed pawn there,
which can give him serious winning chances.} a5 33. g4 Rb5 34. c4 Rb6 35. b5 (

you already know, it's very important to activate all of your pieces before
starting to push the pawns. Still White has a better position, but Black
manages to find some counterplay; and after several mistakes, White faces the
painful loss. This could happen to anyone; so, you should be extremely careful
and clearly understand that the game ends when your opponent shakes your hand.}
