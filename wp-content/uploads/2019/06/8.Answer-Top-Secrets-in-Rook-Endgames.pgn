passed pawn there.} a5 {It was better to activate the rook immediately in the

put your rook as a shield in order to stop the opponent's checks. The problem
with the passive play is that Black can sacrifice the rook for the opponent's

draw.} (44. Kd8 Kf7 45. Rd7 $18 {This is just one of the winning motives. I
