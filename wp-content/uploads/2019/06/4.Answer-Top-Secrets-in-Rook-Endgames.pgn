calculate before playing the f6-check. This move is destroying Black's pawn
structure.} fxg6 61. Rxe6 $18 {White has a winning advantage here because his
pieces are extremely active, and all of Black's pawns are weak.}) 60. b5 $1 {
This was another key element in the position behind White's check on f6. I
hope you spot it before choosing your move. That idea is to deflect the rook
from the f7-pawn protection or to create an outside passed pawn.} Rxb5 (60...

and probably, follow the Kd6 and Kc6 maneuver. When the circumstances are
ready, he can start advancing his powerful and connected passed pawn.}) 61.

planning to play c5, and then b4. Indeed, the c7-pawn is backward, or the d6
will be backward, but White cannot increase the pressure on them, and Black
has a clear strategical plan.} (28... Ra6 $5) (28... Rf8 $5) 29. g3 c5 30. Rcd2
