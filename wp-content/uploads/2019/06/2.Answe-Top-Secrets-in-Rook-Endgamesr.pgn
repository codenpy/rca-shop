example could possible fit in the previews course of the Remote Chess Academy,
called Exchange Pieces like a Pro. If you haven't already studied this course,
I suggest you to do it because exchanging pieces is a very important topic in
chess. In this particular position, White is a little better thanks to his
space advantage and weaknesses on Black's pawn structure. There is no point
here to double the rooks on the d-line because Black is going to exchange all
the rooks and, after that, the position will be equal. In the light of that,
White exchanges only one pair of rooks in order to limit his opponent's
counterplay, and then, he will try to open a line for his other rook.} (24. Rd3
